      <title>Tunable periodically ordered mesoporosity in palladium membranes enables exceptional enhancement of intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for formic acid oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  Developing superior electrocatalysts for formic acid oxidation (FAO) is the most crucial step in commercializing direct formic acid fuel cells. Herein, we electrodeposited fipalladium membranes with periodically ordered mesoporosity by asymmetrically replicating the bicontinuous cubic phase structure of a lyotropic liquid&#8208;crystal template. The palladium membrane possessing the optimal mesoporosity configuration combining the largest periodicity and highest degree of order delivered up to 90.5 m  2  g  &#8211;1  in electrochemical active surface area and 3.34 A mg  &#8211;1  in electrocatalysis capability towards FAO, which are 3.8 and 7.8 times the values of the commercial Pd/C catalyst, respectively. Additionally, by controlling the temperature and potential of the electrodeposition procedure, the periodicity area and order degree of the mesoporosity are highly tunable. The set of corresponding palladium catalysts exhibited a near linearly positive scaling relation between the intrinsic FAO catalytic current and active surface areas, which barely occurred in prior studies. This exceptional electrocatalytic behavior arises from the enhanced accessibility of the interconnected mesochannels and the kinetics of mass transport upon mesoporosity optimization. Moreover, the periodically ordered palladium membrane endowed the prototype formic acid fueled cells with 4.3 and 2.4 times enhancements in the maximum current and power density relative to the commercial Pd/C catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Aminofluorination of Unactivated Alkenes with Et4NF&#8901;3&#8201;HF as a Fluoride Source</title>
      <dc:description>
An asymmetric PdII&#8208;catalyzed aminofluorination of unactivated alkenes using chiral quinoline&#8208;oxazolines (Quox) as ligands provides easy access to an array of enantiomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;fluoropiperidines in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivity. Et4NF&#8901;3&#8201;HF plays an essential role in the enantioselective control, and CsOCF3 as an additive impedes ArIF2&#8208;promoted aminofluorination of alkenes.







Abstract
The first asymmetric PdII&#8208;catalyzed aminofluorination of unactivated alkenes using chiral quinoline&#8208;oxazolines (Quox) as ligands has been developed. This reaction provides easy access to a wide array of enantiomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;fluoropiperidines in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, Et4NF&#8901;3&#8201;HF as a readily accessible nucleophilic fluoride source was found to play an essential role in the enantioselective control, and CsOCF3 also acts a key additive to improve the excellent ee value of products.

      <dc:description>
The speed of light: The syntheses of polycyclic alkaloids (&#8722;)&#8208;FR901483 and (+)&#8208;TAN1251C through a common spirolactam intermediate are reported. Photocatalytic olefin hydroaminoalkylation brings together three readily available building blocks to produce the majority of the carbon framework in one step, leading to concise total syntheses.







Abstract
We report a common strategy to facilitate the syntheses of the polycyclic alkaloids (&#8722;)&#8208;FR901483 (1) and (+)&#8208;TAN1251C (2). A divergent synthetic strategy provides access to both natural products through a pivotal spirolactam intermediate (3), which can be accessed on a gram&#8208;scale. A photocatalytic olefin hydroaminoalkylation brings together three readily available building blocks and forges the majority of the carbon framework present in 1 and 2 in a single operation, leading to concise total syntheses. The complexity&#8208;generating photocatalytic process also provides direct access to novel non&#8208;racemic spirolactam scaffolds that are likely to be of interest to early&#8208;stage drug discovery programs.

      <title>1,1&#8208;Diphenylvinylsulfide as a Functional AIEgen Derived from the Aggregation&#8208;Caused&#8208;Quenching Molecule 1,1&#8208;Diphenylethene through Simple Thioetherification</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple thioetherification between 1,1&#8208;diphenylethene as an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;imparting unit and sodium sulfinates provides a new route for the conversion of compounds with aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) properties into AIE luminogens. This reaction delivers up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions without additional oxidant, and gives access to novel trisubstituted&#8208;ethene&#8208;type AIEgens with potential for use in sensing applications.







Abstract
An efficient and readily scalable thioetherification between 1,1&#8208;diphenylethene (DPE) and sodium arylsulfinate was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;diphenylvinylsulfide (DPVS) with the yield up to 99&#8201;%. The photophysical properties of DPVS show that the introduction of arylsulfenyl groups onto the parent molecule DPE makes DPVS a novel type of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen (AIEgen) with large Stoke's shift (up to 188&#8197;nm). These DPVS possess AIE properties due to restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM), as demonstrated by crystal structure analysis. Importantly, the AIE performance of DPVS can be applied to sense the nitroaromatic explosive picric acid in aqueous systems through a &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; response.

      <title>Real&#8208;Time Atomic&#8208;Scale Visualization of Reversible Copper Surface Activation during the CO Oxidation Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Copper surfer: The atomic&#8208;scale surface activation process of copper during CO oxidation was observed through environmental transmission electron microscopy. 2&#8211;3 atomic layers of the Cu surface are activated with CO and with the help of O2, which intercalates into Cu lattices. CuOx is also observed and believed to be an active species catalyzing the CO oxidation reaction.







Abstract
By using in&#8197;situ aberration&#8208;corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy, for the first time at atomic level, the dynamic evolution of the Cu surface is captured during CO oxidation. Under reaction conditions, the Cu surface is activated, typically involving 2&#8211;3 atomic layers with the formation of a reversible metastable phase that only exists during catalytic reactions. The distinctive role of CO and O2 in the surface activation is revealed, which features CO exposure to lead to surface roughening and consequently formation of low&#8208;coordinated Cu atoms, while O2 exposure induces a quasi&#8208;crystalline CuOx phase. Supported by DFT calculations, it is shown that crystalline CuOx reversibly transforms into the amorphous phase, acting as an active species to facilitate the interaction of gas reactants and catalyzing CO oxidation.

      <title>Formation of Short Zn&#8722;Zn Bonds Stabilized by Simple Cyanide and Isocyanide Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
Cyanogen diluted in argon was reacted with laser ablated Zn atoms to produce the NCZnCN and NCZnZnCN cyanides and their higher energy isocyanide counterparts, as well as ZnNC, which were isolated in excess argon at 4&#8197;K. CCSD(T) calculations find a short 2.367&#8197;&#197; Zn&#8722;Zn bond in the NCZnZnCN cyanide, and a short 2.347&#8197;&#197; Zn&#8722;Zn bond in the higher&#8208;energy isocyanide CNZnZnNC.







Abstract
Cyanogen diluted in argon was reacted with laser ablated Zn atoms to produce the NCZnCN and NCZnZnCN cyanides and higher energy isocyanides ZnNC, CNZnNC, and CNZnZnNC, which were isolated in excess argon at 4&#8197;K. These reaction products, identified from the matrix infrared spectra of their &#8208;CN and &#8208;NC chromophore ligand stretching modes, were confirmed by 13C and 15N isotopic substitution and comparison with frequencies calculated by the B3LYP and CCSD(T) methods using the all electron aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ basis sets. The cyanide and isocyanide products were increased markedly by mercury arc UV photolysis, which covers the zinc atomic absorption. The observed cyanide and dicyanide product frequencies were separated by 87.8, 103.5, and 101.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively. The above electronic structure calculations that produce appropriate ligand frequencies for these dizinc products also provide their Zn&#8722;Zn bond lengths: CCSD(T) calculations find a short 2.367&#8197;&#197; Zn&#8722;Zn bond in the NCZnZnCN cyanide, a shorter 2.347&#8197;&#197; Zn&#8722;Zn bond in the 37.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher energy isocyanide CNZnZnNC, and a longer 4.024&#8197;&#197; bond in the dizinc van der Waals dimer. Thus, the diatomic cyanide (&#8208;CN) and isocyanide (&#8208;NC) ligands are as capable of stabilizing the Zn&#8722;Zn bond as many much larger ligands based on their measured and our calculated Zn&#8722;Zn bond lengths. This is the first example of dizinc complexes stabilized by different ligand isomers. Additional weaker bands in this region can be assigned to the analogous trizinc molecules NCZnZnZnCN and CNZnZnZnNC.

      <title>Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Fragment Couplings that Form Axially Chiral Non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric Biaryls</title>
      <dc:description>
Two become one: A peptide&#8208;catalyzed approach for the atroposelective coupling of naphthols and ester&#8208;bearing quinones to access non&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric BINOL&#8208;type scaffolds is presented. The reaction gives good yields and enantioselectivity, and a diastereoselective functionalization of a naproxen analogue highlights the utility of this system.







Abstract
We have demonstrated that small, modular, tetrameric peptides featuring the Lewis&#8208;basic residue &#946;&#8208;dimethylaminoalanine (Dmaa) are capable of atroposelectively coupling naphthols and ester&#8208;bearing quinones to yield non&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric BINOL&#8208;type scaffolds with good yields and enantioselectivity. The study culminates in the asymmetric synthesis of backbone&#8208;substituted scaffolds similar to 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted BINOLs, such as (R)&#8208;TRIP, with good (94:6 e.r.) to excellent (&gt;99.9:0.1 e.r.) enantioselectivity after recrystallization, and a diastereoselective net arylation of the minimally modified nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen.

      <title>A Factorial Design Approach for Hydrothermal Synthesis of Phase&#8208;Pure AgInO2: A Parametric Optimization Study</title>
      <dc:description>
Design! The factorial design approach was adopted for synthesizing phase&#8208;pure AgInO2 using a hydrothermal route. Silver nitrate and indium nitrate with KOH as a mineralizer promote the formation of AgInO2 in the form of hexagonal nanoplates. The optimum condition of 180&#8201;&#176;C and 4&#8201;m KOH was the crucial combination to obtain the pure phase.







Abstract
Owing to a wide range of industrial applications and fundamental importance, delafossite compounds have gathered tremendous interest in research community. In this study, the formation of hexagonal nanoplates of AgInO2 mainly dominated by (00l) facets with no metallic Ag impurity, reported using a facile hydrothermal route at 180&#8201;&#176;C using KOH as mineralizer by adopting a factorial design approach. Rietveld analysis of the powder XRD pattern and SAED confirms the rhombohedral system of AgInO2. FE&#8208;SEM image shows a uniform hexagonal plate&#8208;like morphology with an average width of about 300&#8197;nm and thickness of 70&#8197;nm. XPS and EDX analysis confirm potassium ion free AgInO2. A specific surface area of about 48.5&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 is arrived from N2 adsorption studies. Temperature&#8208;dependent AC impedance measurements revealed an activation energy of 0.24&#8197;eV/f.u. Further, TG&#8208;DTA studies found that the compound is stable in air up to 595&#8201;&#176;C.

      <title>Exploiting a C&#8208;N bond forming cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for C&#8208;S bond formation</title>

Here, we report intramolecular C&#8208;S bond formation by a P450 monooxygenase, TleB, which normally catalyzes a C&#8208;N bond forming reaction in indolactam V biosynthesis. Based on the proposed reaction mechanism of TleB, a thiol substituted substrate analogue was synthesized and tested in the enzyme reaction, which afforded the unprecedented sulfur&#8208;containing thio&#8208;indolactam V, in addition to an unusual indole&#8208;fused 6/5/8&#8208;tricyclic product whose structure was determined by the crystalline sponge method. Interestingly, the conformational analysis revealed that the SOFA conformation is stable in thio&#8208;indolactam V, in sharp contrast to the major TWIST form in indolactam V, thereby resulting in differences in their biological activities.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploiting Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in a 2D Trilayered Hybrid Ferroelectric for Highly Sensitive Polarized Light Detection</title>
      <dc:description>Polarized light detection is attracting increasing attention for its wide applications ranging from optical switches to high&#8208;resolution photodetectors.

      <title>On the Products of Cholesterol Autoxidation in Phospholipid Bilayers and the Formation of Secosterols Derived Therefrom</title>
      <dc:description>
Cholesterol autoxidation in phospholipid bilayers yields a similar product distribution to that observed in solution, where the epimers of the 7&#8208;hydroperoxide (7&#8208;OOH) are the main products. However, unlike in solution, vitamin&#8197;E does not affect this product distribution. Cholesterol 7&#945;&#8208;OOH, but not 7&#946;&#8208;OOH, undergoes Hock fragmentation to yield novel 6,7&#8208;epoxides and electrophilic A&#8208;ring cleavage products largely indistinguishable from toxic secosterols.







Abstract
In homogenous solution, cholesterol autoxidation leads to a mixture of epimers of 5 primary products, whose concentrations vary in the presence/absence of antioxidants, such as vitamin&#8197;E. Two of the products (5&#945;&#8208;OOH and 6&#946;&#8208;OOH) undergo Hock fragmentation to yield electrophilic secosterols implicated in disease. Herein, we show that the product distribution is similar in phospholipid bilayers, in that the 7&#8208;OOHs are the major products, but the presence/absence of vitamin&#8197;E has no effect on the distribution. Cholesterol 7&#945;&#8208;OOH, but not 7&#946;&#8208;OOH, undergoes Hock fragmentation to yield a mixture of unprecedented A&#8208;ring cleavage products and 6,7&#8208;epoxides. When subjected to typical derivatization conditions, 7&#945;&#8208;OOH yields products with essentially indistinguishable chromatographic and spectroscopic features from the previously identified secosterols, casting further doubt on their controversial origin from endogenous O3.

      <title>Developing Luminescent Ratiometric Thermometers Based on a Covalent Organic Framework (COF)</title>
      <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be grafted with Eu3+ and Tb3+ complexes, which decrease the pore size of the material when attached to the COF. As reported by A.&#8197;M. Kaczmarek, L.&#8197;D. Carlos et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913983), the Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions emit red and green light, respectively, and allow the system to be used as a novel type of luminescence thermometer. This is the first reported example of a COF material being used for this application.

      <title>The Bis(ferrocenyl)phosphenium Ion Revisited</title>
      <dc:description>
Divalent phosphenium ions, [R2P]+, are highly reactive, Lewis superacidic carbene analogues requiring electronic stabilization, which is usually provided by donor atoms. In A.&#8197;H.

Beckmann, and co&#8208;workers came to this conclusion in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913081), in which they examined the molecular and electronic structure of this species.

      <title>Controlling Through&#8208;Space and Through&#8208;Bond Exchange Pathways in Bis&#8208;Cobaltocenes for Molecular Spintronics
</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemical pinching increases the distance between spin centers. This should result in reduced through&#8208;space exchange spin coupling. In naphthalene&#8208;bridged biscobaltocenes, the bridge plays a larger role than anticipated, with pinching leading to an increase of spin coupling. This is important for tuning interactions in spin wires for information transfer.







Abstract
Pinching molecules via chemical strain suggests intuitive consequences, such as compression at the pinched site and clothespin&#8208;like opening of other parts of the structure. If this opening affects two spin centers, it should result in reduced communication between them. We show that for naphthalene&#8208;bridged biscobaltocenes with competing through&#8208;space and through&#8208;bond pathways, the consequences of pinching are far less intuitive: despite the known dominance of through&#8208;space interactions, the bridge plays a much larger role for exchange spin coupling than previously assumed. Based on a combination of chemical synthesis, structural, magnetic, and redox characterization, and a newly developed theoretical pathway analysis, we can suggest a comprehensive explanation for this non&#8208;intuitive behavior. These results are of interest for molecular spintronics, as naphthalene&#8208;linked cobaltocenes can form wires on surfaces for potential spin&#8208;only information transfer.

      <title>A Benzophenone&#8208;Based Photocaging Strategy for the N7 Position of Guanosine</title>
      <dc:description>
Light the way: A strategy was developed to chemically or enzymatically photocage the N7 position of nucleosides, dinucleotides, and RNA, which can be reversed upon irradiation at &#955;max=365&#8197;nm. The well&#8208;known ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl photocaging groups were unsuitable, however aryl ketone derivatives such as benzophenone were identified as photocaging groups for purine imine positions.







Abstract
Selective modification of nucleobases with photolabile caging groups enables the study and control of processes and interactions of nucleic acids. Numerous positions on nucleobases have been targeted, but all involve formal substitution of a hydrogen atom with a photocaging group. Nature, however, also uses ring&#8208;nitrogen methylation, such as m7G and m1A, to change the electronic structure and properties of RNA and control biomolecular interactions essential for translation and turnover. We report that aryl ketones such as benzophenone and &#945;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl ketone are photolabile caging groups if installed at the N7 position of guanosine or the N1 position of adenosine. Common photocaging groups derived from the ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moiety were not suitable. Both chemical and enzymatic methods for site&#8208;specific modification of N7G in nucleosides, dinucleotides, and RNA were developed, thereby opening the door to studying the molecular interactions of m7G and m1A with spatiotemporal control.

Cationic 1,2,3&#8208;triphospholanium salts [LCRP((PhP)2C2H4)][OTf] and dicationic catena&#8208;tetraphosphane&#8208;2,3&#8208;diidum salt [(Ph2P)2(LCMeP)2][OTf]2 were obtained from reactions of Lewis basic phosphanes with dipyrazolylphosphanes [LCRP(pyr)2][OTf] (pyr=3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl). Reaction of triphosphane salt [LCRP(PPh2)2][OTf] with AuCl(tht) led to the cationic gold complex [{(Ph2PPLCiPr)Au}4][OTf]4, which forms a helical structure in the solid state.







Abstract
[LCRP((PhP)2C2H4)][OTf] (4&#8201;a,b[OTf]) and [LCiPrP(PPh2)2][OTf] (5&#8201;b[OTf]) were prepared from the reaction of imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted dipyrazolylphosphane triflate salts [LCRP(pyr)2][OTf] (3&#8201;a,b[OTf]; a: R=Me, b=iPr; LCR=1,3&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl; pyr=3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) with the secondary phosphanes PhP(H)C2H4P(H)Ph) and Ph2PH. A stepwise double P&#8722;N/P&#8722;P bond metathesis to catena&#8208;tetraphosphane&#8208;2,3&#8208;diium triflate salt [(Ph2P)2(LCMeP)2][OTf]2 (7&#8201;a[OTf]2) is observed when reacting 3&#8201;a[OTf] with diphosphane P2Ph4. The coordination ability of 5&#8201;b[OTf] was probed with selected coinage metal salts [Cu(CH3CN)4]OTf, AgOTf and AuCl(tht) (tht=tetrahydrothiophene). For AuCl(tht), the helical complex [{(Ph2PPLCiPr)Au}4][OTf]4 (9[OTf]4) was unexpectedly formed as a result of a chloride&#8208;induced P&#8722;P bond cleavage. The weakly coordinating triflate anion enables the formation of the expected copper(I) and silver(I) complexes [(5&#8201;b)M(CH3CN)3][OTf]2 (M=Cu, Ag) (10[OTf]2, 11[OTf]2).

      <title>Fusion of Different Cross&#8208;linked Polymers Based on Dynamic Disulfide Exchange</title>
      <dc:description>Cross&#8208;linked polymers (CLPs) exhibit exceptional mechanical properties as well as good chemical and solvent resistance. However, their reprocessing, recycling, and modification remain difficult. One promising approach to overcome this limitation is to introduce dynamic covalent bonds that enable chain&#8208;exchange reactions and network&#8208;structure rearrangements in identical polymer networks (A&#8211;A fusion), which results in self&#8208;healing and reprocessing properties. Here, we report the fusion of two distinct polymer networks (A&#8211;B fusion) via the dynamic behavior of bis(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)disulfide (BiTEMPS) at the interface between different CLPs. Fusion of the CLPs was carried out by simply mixing and hot&#8208;pressing powdered CLPs that contain BiTEMPS units. The appearance, swelling behavior, and mechanical properties of the fused samples indicate exchange reactions of the BiTEMPS units and the formation of topological bonds at the interface, commensurate with the generation of a CLP that exhibits tunable properties.</dc:description>

      <title>A Strategy and the Mechanism to Access Hydroxy Functionalized Polypropylene via Coordination Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Preparation of polyethylene containing hydroxyl groups has been already industrialized through radical copolymerization under harsh conditions followed by alcoholysis. On contrary, the hydroxyl functionalized polypropylene has been a rather challenging project of polymer science. Propylene can&#8217;t be polymerized via radical mechanism, and its coordination copolymerization with polar monomers is frustrated by the catalyst poison. Herein we report a new strategy to reach this target. The coordination polymerization of allenes by rare&#8208;earth metal precursors affords pure 1,2&#8208;regulated polyallenes, which are facilely transferred to poly(ally alcohol) analogues followed by hydroboration&#8208;oxidation. Strikingly, the copolymerization of allenes and propylene gives the unprecedented hydroxyl functionalized polypropylene after post&#8208;polymerization modification.

      <dc:description>A considerable challenge in the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) into useful fuels comes from the activation of CO  2  to CO  2  &#8226;&#8208;  or other intermediates, which often requires precious metallic catalysts, high overpotentials, and/or the electrolyte additives (e.g., ionic liquids). We report here a microwave heating strategy for synthesizing a transition metal chalcogenide nanostructure that efficiently catalyzes CO  2  electroreduction to carbon monoxide (CO). We found that the cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoneedle arrays exhibit an unprecedented current density of 212 milliamperes per square centimeter with 95.5 &#177; 4.0% CO Faraday efficiency at &#8208;1.2 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE; without  i  R correction).

      <title>The vital effect of the polyaromatic hydrocarbon for the formation of fullerenes</title>
      <dc:description>Tremendous advances in nanoscience have been made since the discovery of fullerenes. However, the short timescale of the growth process and high&#8208;energy conditions of synthesis result in severe constraints to the investigations of fullerene formation mechanism. This work attempted to reveal the formation process via analyzing the variation of the yield of fullerenes. Experiments and theoretical analysis show that the formation of fullerenes could be affected by the addition of polycyclic aromatics. It is proposed that the formation of C  60  during arc discharge synthesizing is fragment assembling, while the yield of C  2m  (m=35, 38, 39) is strongly enhanced by building block splicing. In addition, several features of the building blocks are put forward to predict the extent of their influence to the formation of larger fullerenes C  2n  (n&#8805;42). This work not only provides essential insight into the formation process of fullerenes, but more importantly also to improve the yield of larger fullerenes selectively.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Modulating coordination environment and electronic structure of metal cations in electrocatalysts can enhance efficiently their activities. Distinguishing optimal geometrical configuration of cobalt cations in spinel oxides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will be of great significance for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts. Herein, we select MgCo2O4, CoCr2O4 and Co2TiO4, where only Co3+ in the center of octahedron (Oh), Co2+ in the center of tetrahedron (Td) and Co2+ in the center of Oh, respectively, can be active sites for OER as model electrocatalysts. The electrochemical results demonstrate Co3+(Oh) sites are the best geometrical configuration for OER. Co2+(Oh) sites exhibit better activity than Co2+(Td). Theoretical calculation demonstrates the conversion of O* to OOH* is the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) for Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td). For Co2+(Oh), it&#8217;s thermodynamically favorable for the formation of OOH* but difficult for the desorption of O2. Co3+(Oh) needs to uphill the lowest Gibbs free energy than Co2+(Oh) and Co2+(Td), which contributes to the best activity. The coexist of Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td) in Co3O4 can effectively promote the formation of OOH* and decrease free energy barrier, which contributes to a charming OER activity.

      <title>DNA origami post&#8208;processing by CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a</title>
      <dc:description>Customizable nanostructures built through the DNA&#8208;origami technique hold tremendous promise in nanomaterial fabrication and biotechnology. Despite the cutting&#8208;edge tools for DNA&#8208;origami design and preparation, it remains challenging to separate structural components of an architecture built from &#8212; thus held together by &#8212; a continuous scaffold strand, which in turn limits the modularity and function of the DNA&#8208;origami devices. To address this challenge, here we present an enzymatic method to clean up and reconfigure DNA&#8208;origami structures. We target single&#8208;stranded (ss) regions of DNA&#8208;origami structures and remove them with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a, a hyper&#8208;active ssDNA endonuclease without sequence specificity. We demonstrate the utility of this facile, selective post&#8208;processing method on DNA structures with various geometrical and mechanical properties, realizing intricate structures and structural transformations that were previously difficult to engineer. Given the biocompatibility of Cas12a&#8208;like enzymes, this versatile tool may be programmed in the future to operate functional nanodevices in cells.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Customizable nanostructures built through the DNA&#8208;origami technique hold tremendous promise in nanomaterial fabrication and biotechnology. Despite the cutting&#8208;edge tools for DNA&#8208;origami design and preparation, it remains challenging to separate structural components of an architecture built from &#8212; thus held together by &#8212; a continuous scaffold strand, which in turn limits the modularity and function of the DNA&#8208;origami devices. To address this challenge, here we present an enzymatic method to clean up and reconfigure DNA&#8208;origami structures. We target single&#8208;stranded (ss) regions of DNA&#8208;origami structures and remove them with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a, a hyper&#8208;active ssDNA endonuclease without sequence specificity. We demonstrate the utility of this facile, selective post&#8208;processing method on DNA structures with various geometrical and mechanical properties, realizing intricate structures and structural transformations that were previously difficult to engineer. Given the biocompatibility of Cas12a&#8208;like enzymes, this versatile tool may be programmed in the future to operate functional nanodevices in cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>High Compression&#8208;Induced Conductivity in a Layered Cu&#8211;Br Perovskite</title>
      <dc:description>We show that the onset pressure for appreciable conductivity in layered copper&#8208;halide perovskites can decrease by ca. 50 GPa upon replacement of Cl with Br. Layered Cu&#8211;Cl perovskites require pressures &gt;50 GPa to show a conductivity of 10&#8722;4 S&#183;cm&#8722;1, whereas here a Cu&#8211;Br congener, (EA)2CuBr4 (EA = ethylammonium), exhibits conductivity as high as 2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#183;cm&#8722;1 at only 2.6 GPa, and 0.17 S&#183;cm&#8722;1 at 59 GPa. Substitution of higher&#8208;energy Br 4p for Cl 3p orbitals lowers the charge&#8208;transfer bandgap of the perovskite by 0.9 eV. This 1.7 eV bandgap decreases to 0.3 eV at 65 GPa. High&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction, optical absorption, and transport measurements, and density functional theory calculations allow us to track compression&#8208;induced structural and electronic changes. The notable enhancement of the Br perovskite's electronic response to pressure may be attributed to more diffuse Br valence orbitals relative to Cl orbitals. This work brings the compression&#8208;induced conductivity of Cu&#8211;halide perovskites to more technologically accessible pressures.</dc:description>

      <title>Branching Regulation in Olefin Polymerization via Lewis Acid Triggered Isomerization of Monomers</title>
      <dc:description>We present a new strategy to regulate branching in chain&#8208;walking olefin polymerization by triggering a rapid isomerization of 1&#8208;alkene monomers into internal olefins by adding a Lewis acid. Polymerization of internal alkenes proceeds via chain&#8208;walking to give polymers with much higher branching than 1&#8208;alkene analogues. The utility of this approach is exemplified by synthesis of well&#8208;defined block copolymers with distinct branching characteristics per block by addition of Lewis acid midway through a reaction. We propose a novel mechanism whereby Lewis acid undergoes a counterion swap with the complex which favors isomerization as well as forming adducts with ancillary ligands, freeing coordination sites for internal alkene coordination polymerization.</dc:description>

      <title>A Facile Photocontrolled Iodine&#8208;Mediated Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Radical Polymerization System: Solution Polymerization of Methacrylates under Irradiation with NIR LED Light</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocontrolled iodine&#8208;mediated reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) of various methacrylates without external photocatalyst was developed using alkyl iodide (e.g., 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;methylpropionitrile, CP&#8208;I) as the initiator at room temperature. We report the first example of using a series of special solvents containing carbonyl groups &#160;(e.g., 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI), N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAc), tetramethylurea (TMU), 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;tetrahydropyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (DMPU), and N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP)) as both solvent and catalyst for photocontrolled RDRP under irradiation with a long wavelength (&#955;max = 730 nm) light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) light. Therefore, the NIR photocontrolled polymerization system has the simplest components: monomer, alkyl iodide initiator and solvent. Well&#8208;defined polymers were synthesized with excellent control over the molecular weights and molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn &lt; 1.21). The &#8220;living&#8221; features of this promising NIR photocontrolled iodine&#8208;mediated RDRP system were confirmed by polymerization kinetics, multiple controlled &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; light switching cycle regulation, and chain extension experiments.

      <title>Chiral Overpass&#8208;Induction in Dynamic Helical Polymers Bearing Pendant Groups with Two Chiral Centers</title>
      <dc:description>The dynamic behaviour of helical polymers bearing pendants with two chiral centers was studied. Controlled conformational changes at the chiral units placed either closer or further to the main chain promote different helical structures. Although the first residue is usually responsible for commanding a specific helicity (P or M), herein it was found that the second chiral center is also able to induce a preferred helical sense when is located spatially closer to the main chain, thereby cancelling the order from the first chiral moiety. This result is achieved through proper coordination with a metal cation. As proof of concept, PPAs that bear one and two chiral amino acid units of different sizes and configuration combinations (L/D alanine and L/D phenylalanine) as pendants were evaluated. In total, ten polymers were studied. This result constitutes the first report of axial control from the remote stereocenter in polymers bearing complex stereopendants.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Target Identification of Benzoxepane Derivatives as Potential Anti&#8208;Neuroinflammatory Agents for Ischemic Stroke</title>
      <dc:description>
Fishing around: The benzoxepane derivative A was effective in vivo, ameliorating both sickness behavior through anti&#8208;inflammation in LPS&#8208;induced neuroinflammatory mice model and cerebral ischemic injury through anti&#8208;neuroinflammation in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Target fishing identified PKM2 as the target protein for A. Furthermore, A exhibited an anti&#8208;neuroinflammatory effect in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting PKM2&#8208;mediated glycolysis and NLRP3 activation.







Abstract
Benzoxepane derivatives were designed and synthesized, and one hit compound emerged as being effective in vitro with low toxicity. In vivo, this hit compound ameliorated both sickness behavior through anti&#8208;inflammation in LPS&#8208;induced neuroinflammatory mice model and cerebral ischemic injury through anti&#8208;neuroinflammation in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Target fishing for the hit compound using photoaffinity probes led to identification of PKM2 as the target protein responsible for anti&#8208;inflammatory effect of the hit compound. Furthermore, the hit exhibited an anti&#8208;neuroinflammatory effect in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting PKM2&#8208;mediated glycolysis and NLRP3 activation, indicating PKM2 as a novel target for neuroinflammation and its related brain disorders. This hit compound has a better safety profile compared to shikonin, a reported PKM2 inhibitor, identifying it as a lead compound in targeting PKM2 for the treatment of inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

      <title>Catalytic Production of Alanine from Waste Glycerol</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct conversion: 43&#8201;% alanine was achieved from crude glycerol over a Ru1Ni7/MgO catalyst. Ni&#8208;doped Ru remarkably promoted lactic acid amination, a key step in the reaction. The catalytic route creates new opportunities for glycerol utilization and enriches the substrate scope of renewable feedstock to access value&#8208;added amino acids.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of amino acids directly from biomass feedstock is rare. Reported here is a one&#8208;step protocol to convert crude glycerol, from the biodiesel industry, into 43&#8201;% alanine over a Ru1Ni7/MgO catalyst. The multifunctional catalytic system promotes glycerol conversion into lactic acid, and then into alanine. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the existence of bimetallic RuNi species, whereas density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggested Ni&#8208;doped Ru substantially decreased the Ea of C&#8722;H bond dissociation of lactate alkoxide to form pyruvate, which is the rate&#8208;determining step. The catalytic route established in this work creates new opportunities for glycerol utilization and enriches the substrate scope of renewable feedstock to access value&#8208;added amino acids.

      <title>Nanoassembly of Oligopeptides and DNA Mimics the Sequential Disassembly of a Spherical Virus</title>
      <dc:description>
En route to gene&#8208;delivery vehicles: A peptide&#8211;DNA spherical artificial virus was formed by the hierarchical assembly of a peptide and DNA through inter&#8208;subunit association. This nanostructure undergoes sequential disassembly at pH&#8197;5.







Abstract
Protein subunits of a low aspect ratio (width over length) with stimuli&#8208;responsiveness are hallmark building blocks of spherical viruses. The interaction of these repeating subunits enables hierarchical assembly for genome packaging and sequential disassembly for optimal genome release. Here, we mimicked these features and constructed a functional spherical artificial virus. The rationally designed 22&#8208;amino acid peptide containing pH&#8208;sensitive histidines and aromatic residues self&#8208;assembled into homogenous nanodiscs of a low aspect ratio (&#8776;7&#215;7&#215;4&#8197;nm). In the presence of DNA, the inter&#8208;nanodisc interactions drove the formation of a viral capsid&#8208;like structure enclosing DNA in the interior. This artificial virus roughly 50&#8197;nm in diameter underwent partial disassembly in response to acidic pH. The resulting intermediate with lowered DNA&#8208;binding affinity continued to protect DNA from nuclease digestion. Such nanostructures, which mimic the intricate morphology and the intracellular transformation of spherical viruses, can be useful for constructing synthetic gene delivery vehicles, as evidenced by their efficient transgene expression.

&lt;p&gt;Protein subunits of a low aspect ratio (width over length) with stimuli&#8208;responsiveness are hallmark building blocks of spherical viruses. The interaction of these repeating subunits enables hierarchical assembly for genome packaging and sequential disassembly for optimal genome release. Here, we mimicked these features and constructed a functional spherical artificial virus. The rationally designed 22&#8208;amino acid peptide containing pH&#8208;sensitive histidines and aromatic residues self&#8208;assembled into homogenous nanodiscs of a low aspect ratio (&#8776;7&#215;7&#215;4&#8197;nm). In the presence of DNA, the inter&#8208;nanodisc interactions drove the formation of a viral capsid&#8208;like structure enclosing DNA in the interior. This artificial virus roughly 50&#8197;nm in diameter underwent partial disassembly in response to acidic pH. The resulting intermediate with lowered DNA&#8208;binding affinity continued to protect DNA from nuclease digestion. Such nanostructures, which mimic the intricate morphology and the intracellular transformation of spherical viruses, can be useful for constructing synthetic gene delivery vehicles, as evidenced by their efficient transgene expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enantioselective Difunctionalization of Alkenes by a Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Heck/Sonogashira Sequence</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual functionalization: An enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryl&#8208;alkynylation of alkenes by a Heck/Sonogashira sequence enables the efficient synthesis of various chiral benzene&#8208;fused heterocycles bearing a propargylic all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Salient features of this process include the use of readily available substrates, high selectivities, and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Sonogashira&#8208;type cross&#8208;couplings are one of the most significant alkynylations in organic chemistry. One of the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Heck/Sonogashira reactions of alkenes with terminal alkynes is now reported. With this method, a variety of uniquely substituted chiral benzene&#8208;fused heterocycles bearing a propargyl&#8208;substituted all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter were obtained in a straightforward, high&#8208;yielding, and highly stereoselective manner under mild conditions. Salient features of this process include the use of readily available substrates, high selectivities, a broad substrate scope as well as versatile product functionalizations.

      <title>Separation of Bromoalkanes Isomers by Nonporous Adaptive Crystals of Leaning Pillar[6]arene</title>
      <dc:description>
The separation of haloalkane isomers is of high practical value in both synthetic chemistry and petrochemical industry. Herein, a simple&#8208;operating and energy&#8208;efficient separation method by using nonporous leaning towerarene crystals to separate bromoalkane isomers is provided.







Abstract
Haloalkanes are important chemicals in synthetic chemistry and petrochemical industry, but the separation of their isomers is a big hurdle. Herein, we report a facile energy&#8208;efficient adsorptive separation strategy using a new class of nonporous adaptive crystals based on leaning pillar[6]arene. Desolvated perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene crystals (EtLP6) with interesting nonporous character show a preference for 1&#8208;bromoalkane isomers over 2&#8208;bromoalkane isomers. EtLP6 is capable of separating 1&#8208;bromopropane, 1&#8208;bromobutane, and 1&#8208;bromopentane from the corresponding 1:1 (v/v) mixtures of 1/2&#8208;positional isomers with purities from 89.6&#8201;% to 96.3&#8201;% in only one adsorption cycle. The selectivity is endowed by the different host&#8211;guest binding modes and different stabilities of EtLP6 crystalloids loaded with 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;positional isomers. Significantly, the guest&#8211;adsorbed assemblies are highly stable at room temperature and EtLP6 can be reused many times without any decrease in performance.

      <title>Additive&#8208;Free Green Light&#8208;Induced Ligation Using BODIPY Triggers</title>
      <dc:description>
Photochemical ligation between BODIPY thioether and propiolate, triggered by green light, enables formation of hydrogel and photo&#8208;patterning of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Photochemical ligation is important in biomaterials engineering for spatiotemporal control of biochemical processes. Such reactions however generally require activation by high energy UV or short wavelength blue light, which can limit their use as a consequence of the potential of these high energy light sources to damage living cells. Herein, we present an additive&#8208;free, biocompatible, chemical ligation triggered by mild visible light. BODIPY dyes with a pendant thioether attached at the meso&#8208;position undergo photolysis of the [C&#8722;S] bond under green light (&#955;=530&#8197;nm) excitation, producing an ion pair intermediate that can react specifically with a propiolate group. The utility of this photochemical ligation in materials science is demonstrated by the fabrication of hydrogels with specific architectures, photo&#8208;immobilization of biomacromolecules, and live cell encapsulation within a hydrogel scaffold.

      <title>A Deep&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Containing an Oxygen&#8208;Deficient Vanadium Oxide Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance cathode for use in deep&#8208;cycle aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries was created by extracting oxygen from vanadium oxide lattices. The mobility of Zn2+ is facilitated and capacity and reversibility of the battery thereby improved. The cathode achieves a stability of 200 cycles with a high capacity of 400&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a utilization efficiency of 95&#8201;%, and a long&#8208;term stability of 2&#8201;000 cycles at a utilization of 67&#8201;%. Key: graphene oxide (GO).







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are attractive because of their inherent safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, viable cathode materials (such as vanadium oxides) suffer from strong Coulombic ion&#8211;lattice interactions with divalent Zn2+, thereby limiting stability when cycled at a high charge/discharge depth with high capacity. A synthetic strategy is reported for an oxygen&#8208;deficient vanadium oxide cathode in which facilitated Zn2+ reaction kinetic enhance capacity and Zn2+ pathways for high reversibility. The benefits for the robust cathode are evident in its performance metrics; the aqueous Zn battery shows an unprecedented stability over 200 cycles with a high specific capacity of approximately 400&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, achieving 95&#8201;% utilization of its theoretical capacity, and a long cycle life up to 2&#8201;000 cycles at a high cathode utilization efficiency of 67&#8201;%. This work opens up a new avenue for synthesis of novel cathode materials with an oxygen&#8208;deficient structure for use in advanced batteries.

Abstract
Starting from diverse alkene&#8208;tethered aryl iodides and O&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;hydroxylamines, the enantioselective reductive cross&#8208;electrophilic 1,2&#8208;carboamination of unactivated alkenes was achieved using a chiral pyrox/nickel complex as the catalyst. This mild, modular, and practical protocol provides rapid access to a variety of &#946;&#8208;chiral amines with an enantioenriched aryl&#8208;substituted quaternary carbon center in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.

      <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of 2&#8208;Amido Benzyl Alcohols: Asymmetric Synthesis of 4H&#8208;3,1&#8208;Benzoxazines</title>
      <dc:description>
A practical approach for the asymmetric synthesis of 4H&#8208;3,1&#8208;benzoxazines was achieved by the kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;amido benzyl alcohols in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). The method demonstrates broad substrate scope and excellent kinetic resolution (with an s factor of up to 94).







Abstract
An efficient method for the asymmetric synthesis of 4H&#8208;3,1&#8208;benzoxazines was developed by kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;amido benzyl alcohols using chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed intramolecular cyclizations. A broad range of benzyl alcohols (both secondary and tertiary alcohols) were kinetically resolved with high selectivities, with an s factor of up to 94. Mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism of these reactions, wherein the amide moieties reacted as the electrophiles. Gram&#8208;scale reaction and facile transformations of the chiral products demonstrate the potential of this method in asymmetric synthesis of biologically active chiral heterocycles.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of 2&#8208;Amido Benzyl Alcohols: Asymmetric Synthesis of 4H&#8208;3,1&#8208;Benzoxazines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A practical approach&lt;/b&gt; for the asymmetric synthesis of 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;3,1&#8208;benzoxazines was achieved by the kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;amido benzyl alcohols in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). The method demonstrates broad substrate scope and excellent kinetic resolution (with an s factor of up to 94).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient method for the asymmetric synthesis of 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;3,1&#8208;benzoxazines was developed by kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;amido benzyl alcohols using chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed intramolecular cyclizations. A broad range of benzyl alcohols (both secondary and tertiary alcohols) were kinetically resolved with high selectivities, with an s factor of up to 94. Mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism of these reactions, wherein the amide moieties reacted as the electrophiles. Gram&#8208;scale reaction and facile transformations of the chiral products demonstrate the potential of this method in asymmetric synthesis of biologically active chiral heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photocontrolled Dopamine Polymerization on DNA Origami with Nanometer Resolution</title>
      <dc:description>
When dopamine is photopolymerized on DNA origami, precisely patterned nanoobjects are obtained with unprecedented spatiotemporal control and nanometer resolution. This approach combines the advantages of visible light as an external stimulus and the unique addressability of the DNA origami methodology.







Abstract
Temporal and spatial control over polydopamine formation on the nanoscale can be achieved by installing an irradiation&#8208;sensitive polymerization system on DNA origami. Precisely distributed G&#8208;quadruplex structures on the DNA template serve as anchors for embedding the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX, which&#8212;upon irradiation with visible light&#8212;induces the multistep oxidation of dopamine to polydopamine, producing polymeric structures on designated areas within the origami framework. The photochemical polymerization process allows exclusive control over polydopamine layer formation through the simple on/off switching of the light source. The obtained polymer&#8211;DNA hybrid material shows significantly enhanced stability, paving the way for biomedical and chemical applications that are typically not possible owing to the sensitivity of DNA.

Furthermore, the surface OVs sufficiently exposed catalytically active sites, and enabled capture of photoexcited electrons at the surface of the catalyst. Internal recombination of photogenerated charges was also limited, which contributed to generation of more active oxygen for NO oxidation. Heterojunction and OVs worked together to form a spatial conductive network framework, which achieved 63% NO removal, 96% selectivity for carbonaceous products (i.e., CO and CH  4  ).

      <title>Chirality&#8208;driven transportation and oxidation prevention by chiral selenium nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>The chirality of nanoparticles directly influences their transport and biological effect under physiological environment, but the details of this phenomenon have rarely been explored. Herein, chiral GSH&#8208;anchored selenium nanoparticles (G@SeNPs) are fabricated to investigate the interaction between their chirality and transport and antioxidant activity. G@SeNPs modified with different enantiomers show opposite handedness with a tunable circular dichroism signal. The noninvasive positron emission tomography imaging clearly reveals that  64  Cu&#8208;labelled  L  &#8208;G@SeNPs experience distinctly different transport among the major organs from their  D  &#8208;and  DL  &#8208;counterparts, demonstrating that the chirality of the G@SeNPs influences the biodistribution and kinetics. Taking advantage of the strong homologous cell adhesion and uptake,  L  &#8208;G@SeNPs have been shown here to effectively prevent oxidation damage caused by palmitic acid in insulinoma cells. This work should motivate the biomedical applications of chiral nanomedicine by providing a fundamental understanding of chirality&#8208;dependent biodistribution and antioxidant activity.</dc:description>

      <title>The Unexpected Role of Se(VI) Species in Epoxidations with Benzeneseleninic Acid and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Benzeneperoxyseleninic acid has been proposed as the key intermediate in the widely used epoxidation of alkenes with benzeneseleninic acid and hydrogen peroxide. However, it reacts sluggishly with cyclooctene and instead rapidly decomposes in solution to a mixed selenonium&#8208;selenonate salt that was identified by x&#8208;ray absorption,  77  Se NMR spectroscopy, and by single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction. This process includes a selenoxide elimination of the peroxyseleninic acid with liberation of oxygen and additional redox steps. The salt is relatively stable in the solid state, but generates the corresponding selenonic acid in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The selenonic acid is inert towards cyclooctene on its own; however, rapid epoxidation occurs when hydrogen peroxide is added. This shows that the selenonic acid must first be activated through further oxidation, presumably to the heretofore unknown benzeneperoxyselenonic acid. The latter is the principal oxidant in this epoxidation.</dc:description>

      <title>Alkali Metals Extend Carrier Lifetimes in Lead Halide Perovskites by Passivating and Eliminating Halide Interstitial Defects</title>
      <dc:description>Defects, such as halide interstitials, form inevitably during synthesis, act as charge recombination centers, induce degradation of halide perovskites, and create major obstacles to multiple applications of these widely popular materials. Recent experiments uncovered that alkali metal dopants greatly improve perovskite performance. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art  ab initio  nonadiabatic molecular dynamics we demonstrate that alkalis bring multiple favorable effects and rationalize the atomistic mechanisms. The formation energy of halide interstitials increases by up to a factor of four in the presence of alkali dopants, and therefore, defect concentration decreases. When defects are present, alkali metals strongly bind to them. Halide interstitials introduce midgap states that rapidly trap charge carriers. Alkalis eliminate the trap states, helping to maintain high current density. In addition to charge trapping, the interstitials accelerate charge recombination. Remarkably, by passivating the interstitials, alkalis make carrier lifetimes up to seven times longer than in defect&#8208;free perovskites and up to thirty times longer than in defective perovskites. These phenomena arise due to a complex interplay of the unusual chemical, structural, electrostatic and quantum properties of halide perovskites. The detailed mechanistic understanding of the improvement of perovskite properties by alkali metal doping provides key insights for defect passivation strategies in perovskites for a broad range of solar and electro&#8208;optic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diode with Enhanced Operational Stability Using Lithium Halide Passivation</title>
      <dc:description>Defect passivation has been demonstrated to be effective in improving the radiative recombination of charge carriers in perovskites, and consequently device performance of the resultant perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art useful passivation agents in perovskite LEDs are mostly organic chelating molecules, which, however, simultaneously sacrifice the charge transport properties and thermal stability of the resultant perovskite emissive layers, deteriorating the performance especially the operational stability of the devices. In this work, we demonstrate that lithium halides can efficiently passivate defects of halide vacancies and reduce trap state density, suppressing ion migration in perovskite films. Efficient green perovskite LEDs based on all inorganic CsPbBr  3  perovskite with a peak external quantum efficiency of 16.2% as well as a high maximum brightness of 50278 cd m  &#8208;2  are achieved. In addtion, the device shows decent stability even under a brightness of 10  4  cd m  &#8208;2  . We highlight the universal applicability of defect passivation using lithium halides, which enable us to improve the efficiency and stability of blue and red perovskite LEDs.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystallization&#8208;Induced Reverse from Dark to Bright Excited States for Construction of Solid&#8208;Emission&#8208;Tunable Squaraines</title>
      <dc:description>Squaraines (SQs) with tunable emission in the solid state is of great importance for various demands, however remaining challenges due to emission quenching upon aggregation. Herein, a unique SQ, named as CIEE&#8208;SQ, is designed to exhibit strong emission in crystal, undergoing crystallization&#8208;induced reverse from dark 1(n + &#963;, &#960;*) to bright 1(&#960;, &#960;*) excited states which was reported for the first time.

Further, co&#8208;crystal between CIEE&#8208;SQ and chloroform largely stabilize the 1(&#960;, &#960;*) state, enhancing the transition dipole moment and decreasing the reorganization energy to boost the fluorescence, which is promising in data encryption and decryption.

      <title>Axial TADF Enantiomers Designed for Efficient Blue Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>A chiral emitting skeleton strategy for the axial TADF enantiomers with CPEL properties has been proposed. Consequently, a pair of chiral stable enantiomers (&#8208;)&#8208;(S)&#8208;Cz&#8208;Ax&#8208;CN and (+)&#8208;(R)&#8208;Cz&#8208;Ax&#8208;CN were designed and synthesized. The enantiomers with both intramolecular &#960;&#8208;conjugated charge transfer (CT) and spatial CT not only showed TADF activities with small &#8710;EST of 0.029 eV, but also exhibited mirror&#8208;image CPL activities with large glum. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the enantiomers emitted blue electroluminescence centered at 468 nm with EQE of 12.5 and 12.7%, and also showed intense CPEL with gEL values of &#8208;1.2&#215;10&#8208;2 and +1.4&#215;10&#8208;2, respectively. This is the first CP&#8208;OLEDs based on TADF enantiomers with efficient blue CPEL.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A chiral emitting skeleton strategy for the axial TADF enantiomers with CPEL properties has been proposed. Consequently, a pair of chiral stable enantiomers (&#8208;)&#8208;(S)&#8208;Cz&#8208;Ax&#8208;CN and (+)&#8208;(R)&#8208;Cz&#8208;Ax&#8208;CN were designed and synthesized. The enantiomers with both intramolecular &#960;&#8208;conjugated charge transfer (CT) and spatial CT not only showed TADF activities with small &#8710;EST of 0.029 eV, but also exhibited mirror&#8208;image CPL activities with large glum. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the enantiomers emitted blue electroluminescence centered at 468 nm with EQE of 12.5 and 12.7%, and also showed intense CPEL with gEL values of &#8208;1.2&#215;10&#8208;2 and +1.4&#215;10&#8208;2, respectively. This is the first CP&#8208;OLEDs based on TADF enantiomers with efficient blue CPEL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Triangulene series: from precursor design towards on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterization</title>
      <dc:description>Triangulene and its higher homologs are a class of zigzag&#8208;edged triangular graphene molecules (ZTGMs) with high&#8208;spin ground states. These open&#8208;shell molecules are predicted to host ferromagnetically coupled edge states with net spins scaling with the molecular size, which are considered as the promising candidates for future molecular spintronics applications. Unfortunately, the synthesis of unsubstituted [n]triangulene series and the direct observation of their edge states have been a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the molecules&#8217; high chemical reactivity towards oxygen. However, recent advances in the rational design of elegant organic precursors allows for the on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterization of three types of unsubstituted [n]triangulene series, namely [3]&#8208;, [4]&#8208; and [5]triangulene. In this review, we will highlight the key aspects of this rapidly&#8208;developing field ranging from the principles of precursor design to synthetic strategies and characterization of the fundamental properties of a homologous series of triangulene molecules synthesized on the surface. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions in this field.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Properties of 2,3&#8208;Diethynyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;Butadienes</title>
      <dc:description>The first general preparative access to compounds of the 2,3&#8208;diethynyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (DEBD) class is reported. The successful synthesis involves a one pot, twofold Sonogashira&#8208;type, Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed union of two terminal alkynes and a carbonate derivative of a 2&#8208;butyne&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol. The synthesis is broad in scope, as evidenced by the preparation of 30 diversely&#8208;substituted DEBDs. Members of this structural family are sufficiently kinetically stable to be handled using standard laboratory techniques at ambient temperature. They decompose primarily through heat&#8208;promoted cyclodimerizations. Alkyl substitution is shown to slow the rate of decomposition whereas extended conjugation through aryl or alkenyl substitution accelerates it. An iterative sequence of these unprecedented Sonogashira&#8208;type couplings generates a new type of expanded dendralene. A suitably&#8208;substituted DEBD carrying two terminal alkyne groups undergoes Glaser&#8208;Eglinton cyclo&#8208;oligomerization to produce a new class of expanded radialenes. These unprecedented cyclic hydrocarbons are chiral, by virtue of restricted rotation about the C2&#8211;C3 bond of their constituent 1,3&#8208;butadiene residues. The structural features giving rise to atropisomerism in these expanded radialenes are distinct from those reported previously.</dc:description>

      <title>Acid Exfoliation of Imine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables Solution Processing into Crystalline Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highly modular, porous, crystalline polymers of interest for charge storage devices, nanofiltration membranes, optoelectronic devices, and more. COFs are typically synthesized as microcrystalline powders, a morphology that limits their performance in these applications, and their limited solubility precludes large&#8208;scale processing into more useful morphologies and devices. Here, we report a general, scalable method to exfoliate two&#8208;dimensional imine&#8208;linked COF powders by temporarily protonating their linkages. The resulting suspensions were cast into continuous, crystalline COF films up to 10 cm in diameter, with thicknesses ranging from 50 nm to 20 &#181;m depending on the suspension composition, concentration, and casting protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the film fabrication process proceeds through a partial depolymerization/repolymerization mechanism, providing mechanically robust films that can be easily separated from their substrates. Acid&#8208;mediated exfoliation is a promising strategy for solution processing readily accessible imine&#8208;linked COF powders into functional devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Transformation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases into Glutamate Receptors and Photoreceptors</title>
      <dc:description>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are key regulators of cellular functions in metazoans. In vertebrates, RTKs are mostly activated by polypeptides but are not naturally sensitive to amino acids or light. Taking inspiration from Venus Kinase Receptors (VKRs), an atypical family of RTKs found in Nature, we have achieved the transformation of the human insulin (hIR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (hMET) into glutamate receptors by replacing their extracellular binding domains with the ligand&#8208;binding domain of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 2 (mGluR2). We then imparted light sensitivity by covalent attachment of a synthetic, glutamate&#8208;based photoswitch onto a self&#8208;labelling SNAP tag. Employing a&#160;Xenopus laevis&#160;oocyte kinase activity assay, we demonstrate how these chimeric RTKs, termed LihIR (Light&#8208;controlled human Insulin Receptor) and LihMET (Light&#8208;controlled human MET Receptor), can be used to exert optical control over insulin or MET signaling pathways. Our results outline a potentially general strategy to convert RTKs into photoreceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Fragment coupling reactions in total synthesis that form carbon&#8212;carbon bonds via carbanionic or free radical intermediates.</title>
      <dc:description>Fragment coupling reactions that form carbon&#8211;carbon bonds are valuable transformations in synthetic design. Advances in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions in the early 2000s brought a high level of predictability and reliability to carbon&#8211;carbon bond constructions involving the union of unsaturated fragments. By comparison, recent years have witnessed an increase in fragment couplings proceeding via carbanionic and open shell (free radical) intermediates. The latter has been driven by advances in methods to generate and utilize carbon&#8208;centered radicals under mild conditions. In this review, we survey a selection of recent syntheses that have implemented carbanion&#8208; or radical&#8208;based fragment couplings to form carbon&#8211; carbon bonds. We aim to highlight the strategic value of these disconnections in their respective settings and to identify extensible lessons from each example that might be instructive to students.</dc:description>

      <title>Deconstructive Oxygenation of Unstrained Cycloalkanamines</title>
      <dc:description>A deconstructive oxygenation of unstrained primary cycloalkanamines has been developed for the first time via an auto&#8208;oxidative aromatization promoted C(sp  3  )&#8208;C(sp  3  ) bond cleavage strategy. This metal&#8208;free method involves the substitution reaction of cycloalkanamines with hydrazonyl chlorides and subsequent auto&#8208;oxidative annulation to in&#8208;situ generate pre&#8208;aromatics, followed by N&#8208;radical&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening and further oxygenation by 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy (TEMPO) and m&#8208;cholorperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). High ring&#8208;opening efficiency of unstrained cycloalkanamines is achieved by resulting in 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing acyclic carbonyl compounds. This protocol features one&#8208;pot operation, mild conditions, high regioselectivity, broad substrates scope, and is compatible with alkaloids, osamines, peptides as well as steroids.</dc:description>

      <title>Mass Activated Droplet Sorting (MADS) Enables High Throughput Screening of Enzymatic Reactions at Nanoliter Scale</title>
      <dc:description>Microfluidic droplet sorting enables the high throughput screening and selection of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil microreactors at speeds and volumes unparalleled by traditional well&#8208;plate approaches. Most such systems sort using fluorescent reporters on modified substrates or reactions that are rarely industrially relevant. We describe a microfluidic system for high throughput sorting of nanoliter droplets based on direct detection using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS). Droplets are split, one portion is analyzed by ESI&#8208;MS, and the second portion is sorted based on the MS result. Throughput of 0.7 samples/s is achieved with 98% accuracy using a self&#8208;correcting and adaptive sorting algorithm. We use the system to screen ~15,000 samples in 6 h and demonstrate its utility by sorting 25 nL droplets containing transaminase expressed  in vitro  . Label&#8208;free ESI&#8208;MS droplet screening expands the toolbox for droplet detection and recovery, improving the applicability of droplet sorting to protein engineering, drug discovery, and diagnostic workflows.</dc:description>

      <title>Enriched Surface Oxygen Vacancies of Photoanodes by Photoetching with Enhanced Charge Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface oxygen vacancies play a significant role in BiVO4 photoanodes during the solar water splitting. Photoetching effectively introduce the surface oxygen vacancies on BiVO4 photoanodes, which enhances the charge separation at the BiVO4/electrolyte interface.







Abstract
A facile photoetching approach is described that alleviates the negative effects from bulk defects by confining the oxygen vacancy (Ovac) at the surface of BiVO4 photoanode, by 10&#8208;minute photoetching. This strategy could induce enriched Ovac at the surface of BiVO4, which avoids the formation of excessive bulk defects. A mechanism is proposed to explain the enhanced charge separation at the BiVO4&#8197;/electrolyte interface, which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The optimized BiVO4 with enriched surface Ovac presents the highest photocurrent among undoped BiVO4 photoanodes. Upon loading FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalysts, photoetched BiVO4 photoanode reaches a considerable water oxidation photocurrent of 3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. An unbiased solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 3.5&#8201;% is realized by this BiVO4 photoanode and a Si photocathode under 1 sun illumination.

      <title>Super&#8208;Soft and Super&#8208;Elastic DNA Robot with Magnetically Driven Navigational Locomotion for Cell Delivery in Confined Space</title>
      <dc:description>
Do the locomotion with me: A super&#8208;soft and super&#8208;elastic DNA robot is fabricated based on magnetic DNA hydrogel. Our DNA robot presents a shape&#8208;adaptive property and enables magnetically driven navigational locomotion in confined space, which can work as a vehicle to deliver living cells.







Abstract
Soft organisms such as earthworms can access confined, narrow spaces, inspiring scientists to fabricate soft robots for in vivo manipulation of cells or tissues and minimally invasive surgery. We report a super&#8208;soft and super&#8208;elastic magnetic DNA hydrogel&#8208;based soft robot (DNA robot), which presents a shape&#8208;adaptive property and enables magnetically driven navigational locomotion in confined and unstructured space. The DNA hydrogel is designed with a combinational dynamic and permanent crosslinking network through chain entanglement and DNA hybridization, resulting in shear&#8208;thinning and cyclic strain properties. DNA robot completes a series of complex magnetically driven navigational locomotion such as passing through narrow channels and pipes, entering grooves and itinerating in a maze by adapting and recovering its shape. DNA robot successfully works as a vehicle to deliver cells in confined space by virtue of the 3D porous networked structure and great biocompatibility.

      <title>Hole and Electron Doping of the 4d Transition&#8208;Metal Oxyhydride LaSr3NiRuO4H4</title>
      <dc:description>
Partially occupied: Hole or electron doping the oxyhydride LaSr3NiRuO4H4 creates a system with partial occupancy in the Ni/Ru 
&#8211;H&#8201;1s bands located in the (Ni/Ru)H2 sheets of these phases, which are analogous to the Cu 
&#8211;O&#8201;2p bands present in the CuO2 sheets of hole&#8208;doped superconducting cuprates.







Abstract
Hole or electron doping of phases prepared by topochemical reactions (e.g. anion deintercalation or anion&#8208;exchange) is extremely challenging as these low&#8208;temperature conversion reactions are typically very sensitive to the electron counts of precursor phases. Herein we report the successful hole and electron doping of the transition&#8208;metal oxyhydride LaSr3NiRuO4H4 by first preparing precursors in the range LaxSr4&#8722;xNiRuO8 0.5&lt;x&lt;1.4 and then converting into the corresponding LaxSr4&#8722;xNiRuO4H4 phases. This is particularly noteworthy as the (Ni/Ru)H2 sheets in the LaxSr4&#8722;xNiRuO4H4 phases are structurally analogous to the CuO2 sheets in cuprate superconductors and hole doping (Ni1+/2+, Ru2+) or electron doping (Ni2+, Ru1+/2+) yields materials with partial occupancy in Ni/Ru 
&#8211;H&#8201;1s bands which are analogous to the partially occupied Cu 
&#8211;O&#8201;2p bands present in the CuO2 sheets of doped superconducting cuprates.

Total determination: The total structure determination of an alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanocluster, Au22(tBuC&#8801;C)18, has been achieved. It consists of a Au13 cuboctahedron kernel and three [Au3(tBuC&#8801;C)4] trimeric staples.

Abstract
An alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanocluster, Au22(tBuC&#8801;C)18 (1), has been synthesized and its structure has been determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The molecular structure consists of a Au13 cuboctahedron kernel and three [Au3(tBuC&#8801;C)4] trimeric staples. The cluster 1 has strong luminescence in the solid state with a 15&#8201;% quantum yield, and it displays interesting thermochromic luminescence as revealed by temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra. The enhanced room&#8208;temperature emission is characterized as thermally activated delayed fluorescence.

      <dc:description>With the ever&#8208;increasing threat posed by the multi&#8208;drug resistance of bacteria, the development of non&#8208;antibiotic agents for the broad&#8208;spectrum eradication of clinically prevalent superbugs has remained a global challenge.

This combined approach proved synergistic, providing an impressive antimicrobial effect that led to complete annihilation of a wide spectrum of gram&#8208;positive, gram&#8208;negative, and drug resistant bacteria both in vitro and in vivo.

      <title>Observing the Defect Passivation of Grain Boundary&#160;with 2&#8208;Aminoterephthalic Acid for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), with their exceptional properties, hold potential as photoelectric converters. However, defects in the perovskite layer, particularly at the grain boundaries (GBs), seriously restrict the performance and stability of PSCs. Herein, we present a simple post&#8208;treatment procedure by applying 2&#8208;aminoterephthalic acid to the perovskite to produce efficient and stable PSCs. By optimizing the post&#8208;treatment conditions, we created a device that achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.09% and demonstrated improved stability. This improvement was attributed to the fact that the 2&#8208;aminoterephthalic acid acted as a cross&#8208;linking agent that inhibited the migration of ions and passivated the trap states at GBs. These findings provide a potential strategy for designing efficient and stable PSCs regarding the aspects of defect passivation and crystal growth.</dc:description>

Abstract
A highly enantioselective synthesis of &#948;&#8208;lactams having a chiral quaternary carbon center at the &#945;&#8208;position has been developed through an asymmetric alkylation of 3&#8208;arylpiperidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones under phase&#8208;transfer conditions.

      <dc:description>Disulfide bonds typically introduce conformational constraints into peptides and proteins, conferring improved biopharmaceutical properties and greater therapeutic potential. In our opinion, disulfide&#8208;rich micro&#8208;domains from proteins are potentially a rich and under&#8208;explored source of drug leads.

EGF&#8208;like domains exhibit large diversity in their disulfide bond topologies and calcium binding modes, which we classify in detail here. We found that many EGF&#8208;like domains are associated with disease phenotypes, and the interactions they mediate are potential therapeutic targets. Indeed, EGF&#8208;based therapeutic leads have been identified, and we further propose that these domains can be optimized to expand their therapeutic potential using chemical design strategies.

      <title>A Black Phosphorus&#8211;Graphite Composite Anode for Li&#8208;/Na&#8208;/K&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Into the black: The energy&#8208;storage properties of black phosphorus are reported for Li/Na/K ion batteries. BP shows the lowest utilization for K+ storage than for Na+ and Li+, which is ascribed to the highest formation energy and the lowest ion diffusion coefficient of the final potassiation product K3P compared with Li3P and Na3P.







Abstract
Black phosphorus (BP) is a desirable anode material for alkali metal ion storage owing to its high electronic/ionic conductivity and theoretical capacity. In&#8208;depth understanding of the redox reactions between BP and the alkali metal ions is key to reveal the potential and limitations of BP, and thus to guide the design of BP&#8208;based composites for high&#8208;performance alkali metal ion batteries. Comparative studies of the electrochemical reactions of Li+, Na+, and K+ with BP were performed. Ex&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculation reveal the lowest utilization of BP for K+ storage than for Na+ and Li+, which is ascribed to the highest formation energy and the lowest ion diffusion coefficient of the final potassiation product K3P, compared with Li3P and Na3P. As a result, restricting the formation of K3P by limiting the discharge voltage achieves a gravimetric capacity of 1300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 which retains at 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50 cycles at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

      <title>A Light&#8208;Triggerable Nanoparticle Library for the Controlled Release of Non&#8208;Coding RNAs</title>
      <dc:description>
A light&#8208;sensitive nanoparticle library was synthesized to deliver non&#8208;coding RNAs. Six formulations were more efficient (up to 500&#8201;%) than commercially available lipofectamine in gene&#8208;knockdown activity. These formulations showed differential internalization by skin cells and the endosomal escape was rapid (minutes range). The utility of these light&#8208;triggerable nanoparticles was demonstrated in the context of wound healing.







Abstract
RNA&#8208;based therapies offer a wide range of therapeutic interventions including the treatment of skin diseases; however, the strategies to efficiently deliver these biomolecules are still limited due to obstacles related to the cellular uptake and cytoplasmic delivery. Herein, we report the synthesis of a triggerable polymeric nanoparticle (NP) library composed of 160 formulations, presenting physico&#8208;chemical diversity and differential responsiveness to light. Six formulations were more efficient (up to 500&#8201;%) than commercially available lipofectamine in gene&#8208;knockdown activity. These formulations showed differential internalization by skin cells and the endosomal escape was rapid (minutes range). The NPs were effective in the release of siRNA and miRNA. Acute skin wounds treated with the top hit NP complexed with miRNA&#8208;150&#8208;5p healed faster than wounds treated with scrambled miRNA. Light&#8208;activatable NPs offer a new strategy to topically deliver non&#8208;coding RNAs.

      <title>Preferential Formation of Mono&#8208;Metallofullerenes Governed by the Encapsulation Energy of the Metal Elements: A Case Study on Eu@C2n (2n=74&#8211;84) Revealing a General Rule</title>
      <dc:description>
Energy trumps size: The encapsulation energy of endohedral metal elements is shown to be a key factor which governs the preferential formation of mono&#8208;metallofullerenes during the arc&#8208;discharge when europium is used. This concept also rationalizes similar observations for metallofullerenes containing other metals like Ca, Sr, Ba, or Yb.







Abstract
Encapsulating one to three metal atoms or a metallic cluster inside fullerene cages affords endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) classified as mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and cluster&#8208;EMFs, respectively. Although the coexistence of various EMF species in soot is common for rare&#8208;earth metals, we herein report that europium tends to prefer the formation of mono&#8208;EMFs. Mass spectroscopy reveals that mono&#8208;EMFs (Eu@C2n) prevail in the Eu&#8208;containing soot. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the encapsulation energy of the endohedral metal accounts for the selective formation of mono&#8208;EMFs and rationalize similar observations for EMFs containing other metals like Ca, Sr, Ba, or Yb. Consistently, all isolated Eu&#8208;EMFs are mono&#8208;EMFs, including Eu@D3h(1)&#8208;C74, Eu@C2v(19138)&#8208;C76, Eu@C2v(3)&#8208;C78, Eu@C2v(3)&#8208;C80, and Eu@D3d(19)&#8208;C84, which are identified by crystallography. Remarkably, Eu@C2v(19138)&#8208;C76 represents the first Eu&#8208;containing EMF with a cage that violates the isolated&#8208;pentagon&#8208;rule, and Eu@C2v(3)&#8208;C78 is the first C78&#8208;based EMF stabilized by merely one metal atom.

Mass spectroscopy reveals that mono&#8208;EMFs (Eu@C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) prevail in the Eu&#8208;containing soot. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the encapsulation energy of the endohedral metal accounts for the selective formation of mono&#8208;EMFs and rationalize similar observations for EMFs containing other metals like Ca, Sr, Ba, or Yb. Consistently, all isolated Eu&#8208;EMFs are mono&#8208;EMFs, including Eu@&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(1)&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;74&lt;/sub&gt;, Eu@&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(19138)&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;76&lt;/sub&gt;, Eu@&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(3)&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;78&lt;/sub&gt;, Eu@&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(3)&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;, and Eu@&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(19)&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;84&lt;/sub&gt;, which are identified by crystallography. Remarkably, Eu@&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(19138)&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;76&lt;/sub&gt; represents the first Eu&#8208;containing EMF with a cage that violates the isolated&#8208;pentagon&#8208;rule, and Eu@&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(3)&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;78&lt;/sub&gt; is the first C&lt;sub&gt;78&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based EMF stabilized by merely one metal atom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Real&#8208;Time NMR Spectroscopy for Studying Metabolism</title>
      <dc:description>
Seeing is believing: A newly developed approach for monitoring living&#8208;cell metabolism in a cell&#8208;friendly environment is reported, paving the way for bringing NMR spectroscopy closer to personalized medicine.







Abstract
Current metabolomics approaches utilize cellular metabolite extracts, are destructive, and require high cell numbers. We introduce here an approach that enables the monitoring of cellular metabolism at lower cell numbers by observing the consumption/production of different metabolites over several kinetic data points of up to 48&#8197;hours. Our approach does not influence cellular viability, as we optimized the cellular matrix in comparison to other materials used in a variety of in&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy experiments. We are able to monitor real&#8208;time metabolism of primary patient cells, which are extremely sensitive to external stress. Measurements are set up in an interleaved manner with short acquisition times (approximately 7&#8197;minutes per sample), which allows the monitoring of up to 15 patient samples simultaneously. Further, we implemented our approach for performing tracer&#8208;based assays. Our approach will be important not only in the metabolomics fields, but also in individualized diagnostics.

      <title>Crystal&#8208;Growth&#8208;Dominated Fabrication of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Orderly Distributed Hierarchical Porosity</title>
      <dc:description>
HP&#8208;MOFs: A crystal&#8208;growth&#8208;dominated synthetic strategy is proposed to achieve hierarchically porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The HP&#8208;MOFs have a wide pore size distribution and an orderly distributed porosity in the radial direction. Benefitting from the hierarchical architecture, HP&#8208;MOFs exhibit enhanced catalytic efficiency in styrene oxidation.







Abstract
Constructing architectures with hierarchical porosity has been widely considered as the most efficient way to bypass the problems related to slow mass transfer and inaccessibility of internal space in MOFs. Now, a crystal&#8208;growth&#8208;dominated strategy is proposed to fabricate hierarchically porous MOFs (HP&#8208;MOFs). When the crystal growth is dominated by the monomer attachment, the aggregation of nonionic surfactant or polymer can be easily captured and released during the crystal growth process, resulting in the formation and ordering hierarchical pores along the radial direction. Owing to the accelerated mass diffusion and more exposed active sites of this design, HP&#8208;MOFs exhibited an enhanced catalytic efficiency in styrene oxidation.

      <title>A Class of FeIII Macrocyclic Complexes with Alcohol Donor Groups as Effective T1 MRI Contrast Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;spin iron(III) complexes with an open coordination site for solvent interactions are effective T1 MRI contrast agents in phantoms and in live mice. A coordinated water ligand and the deprotonation of a pendant alcohol stabilize the trivalent iron center to produce strong second&#8208;sphere water interactions.







Abstract
Early studies suggested that FeIII complexes cannot compete with GdIII complexes as T1 MRI contrast agents. Now it is shown that one member of a class of high&#8208;spin macrocyclic FeIII complexes produces more intense contrast in mice kidneys and liver at 30&#8197;minutes post&#8208;injection than does a commercially used GdIII agent and also produces similar T1 relaxivity in serum phantoms at 4.7&#8197;T and 37&#8201;&#176;C. Comparison of four different FeIII macrocyclic complexes elucidates the factors that contribute to relaxivity in&#8197;vivo including solution speciation. Variable&#8208;temperature 17O NMR studies suggest that none of the complexes has a single, integral inner&#8208;sphere water that exchanges rapidly on the NMR timescale. MRI studies in mice show large in&#8197;vivo differences of three of the FeIII complexes that correspond, in part, to their r1 relaxivity in phantoms. Changes in overall charge of the complex modulate contrast enhancement, especially of the kidneys.

      <title>Heat&#8208;Treated Aerogel as a Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Earth&#8208;abundant elements and a built&#8208;in support: A novel iron porphyrin aerogel was prepared that has a very high concentration of atomically dispersed catalytic sites (9.7&#215;1020&#8197;sites&#8201;g&#8722;1) capable of catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution (Eonset=0.92&#8197;V vs. RHE, TOF=0.25&#8197;e&#8722;&#8201;site&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 0.80&#8197;V vs. RHE).







Abstract
Aerogels are fascinating materials that can be used for a wide range of applications, one of which is electrocatalysis of the important oxygen reduction reaction. In their inorganic form, aerogels can have ultrahigh catalytic site density, high surface area, and tunable physical properties and chemical structures&#8212;important features in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we report on the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of an iron&#8211;porphyrin aerogel. 5,10,15,20&#8208;(Tetra&#8208;4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (H2TAPP) and FeII were used as building blocks of the aerogel, which was later heat&#8208;treated at 600&#8201;&#176;C to enhance electronic conductivity and catalytic activity, while preserving its macrostructure. The resulting material has a very high concentration of atomically dispersed catalytic sites (9.7&#215;1020&#8197;sites&#8201;g&#8722;1) capable of catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution (Eonset=0.92&#8197;V vs. RHE, TOF=0.25&#8197;e&#8722;&#8201;site&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 0.80&#8197;V vs. RHE).

Herein, we report on the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of an iron&#8211;porphyrin aerogel. 5,10,15,20&#8208;(Tetra&#8208;4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TAPP) and Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; were used as building blocks of the aerogel, which was later heat&#8208;treated at 600&#8201;&#176;C to enhance electronic conductivity and catalytic activity, while preserving its macrostructure. The resulting material has a very high concentration of atomically dispersed catalytic sites (9.7&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;sites&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) capable of catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;onset&lt;/sub&gt;=0.92&#8197;V vs. RHE, TOF=0.25&#8197;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;site&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.80&#8197;V vs. RHE).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Solid&#8208;State Reference Electrode Based on a Self&#8208;Referencing Pulstrode</title>
      <dc:description>
Pulstrode! A solid&#8208;state reference electrode principle is proposed that relies on a self&#8208;referencing Ag/AgI element. An applied current pulse generates iodide ions that dictate the reference electrode potential, which are subsequently recaptured.







Abstract
The design of solid&#8208;state reference electrodes without a liquid junction is important to allow miniature and cost&#8208;effective electrochemical sensors. To address this, a pulse control is proposed using an Ag/AgI element as reliable solid&#8208;state reference electrode. It involves the local release of iodide by a cathodic current that is immediately followed by an electromotive force (EMF) measurement that serves as the reference potential. The recapture of iodide ions is achieved by potentiostatic control. This results in intermittent potential values that are reproducible to less than one millivolt (SD=0.27&#8197;mV, n=50). The ionic strength is shown to influence the activity coefficient of released iodide in accordance with the extended Debye&#8211;H&#252;ckel equation, resulting in a predictable change of the potential reading. The principle is applied to potentiometric potassium detection with a valinomycin&#8208;based ion&#8208;selective electrode (ISE), demonstrating a completely solid&#8208;state sensor configuration.

      <dc:description>
Wacker anti attack: Asymmetric anti attack of weak nucleophiles on cyclic alkenes proceeded without the aid of directing groups or tethering of the alkene to the palladium center. The three&#8208;component oxyallenylation reaction (see scheme) gave trans adducts exclusively with excellent enantioselectivity and is applicable to a wide range of oxygen nucleophiles and some electron&#8208;poor aryl amines.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carboetherification of cyclic alkenes proceeded to give trans adducts exclusively with excellent enantioselectivity through a Wacker&#8208;type pathway. The reaction is also applicable to other oxygen nucleophiles, such as water, phenols, and carboxylic acids, as well as some electron&#8208;poor aryl amines.

      <title>Porphyrin/Quinoidal&#8208;Bithiophene&#8208;Based Macrocycles and Their Dications: Template&#8208;Free Synthesis and Global Aromaticity</title>
      <dc:description>
Adaptable porphyrin&#8208;based macrocycles: Macrocycles containing aromatic porphyrin and quinoidal bithiophene units were synthesized by a template&#8208;free method. The molecules adopted a distorted conformation with local aromaticity in the neutral state, but a more planar geometry with global aromaticity in the dication state (see picture).







Abstract
We report the template&#8208;free synthesis and characterization of a new type of porphyrin/quinoidal&#8208;bithiophene&#8208;based conjugated macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the dimer (2MC) revealed a cyclophane&#8208;like geometry with large dihedral angles between the porphyrin and the neighboring thiophene rings, and NMR measurements and theoretical calculations confirmed a localized aromatic character of the porphyrin/thiophene rings and quinoidal character of the bithiophene linkers. Restricted rotation of the thiophene rings linked to the porphyrin unit was observed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements. The dication (2MC2+) adopts a chair&#8208;shaped conformation to facilitate &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization around the whole macrocycle. As a result, the molecule is globally aromatic, with a dominant 54&#8201;&#960; conjugation pathway. The trimer (3MC) also shows localized aromatic character of porphyrin rings and conformational flexibility, but its dication (3MC2+) is rigid and globally aromatic with a dominant 82&#8201;&#960; conjugation pathway.

      <title>A General Route to Prepare Low&#8208;Ruthenium&#8208;Content Bimetallic Electrocatalysts for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction by Using Carbon Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>
How low can Ru go: A scalable and general synthetic method for the preparation of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped RuM/carbon quantum dots (CQDs; M=Ni, Mn, Cu) has been developed through metal&#8208;mediated CQD condensation and carbonization. The low ruthenium content RuM/CQD catalysts exhibit outstanding activity and stability in catalyzing hydrogen evolution at all pH values.







Abstract
A challenging but pressing task to design and synthesize novel, efficient, and robust pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts for scalable and sustainable hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we report a facile method to prepare an efficient and robust Ru&#8208;M (M=Ni, Mn, Cu) bimetal nanoparticle and carbon quantum dot hybrid (RuM/CQDs) for pH&#8208;universal HER. The RuNi/CQDs catalysts exhibit outstanding HER performance at all pH levels. The unexpected low overpotentials of 13, 58, and 18&#8197;mV shown by RuNi/CQDs allow a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8201;m KOH, 0.5&#8201;m H2SO4, and 1&#8201;m PBS, respectively, for Ru loading at 5.93&#8197;&#956;gRu&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This performance is among the best catalytic activities reported for any platinum&#8208;free electrocatalyst. Theoretical studies reveal that Ni doping results in a moderate weakening of the hydrogen bonding energy of nearby surface Ru atoms, which plays a critical role in improving the HER activity.

      <title>Controllable Synthesis of Multicompartmental Particles Using 3D Microfluidics</title>
      <dc:description>
A microfluidic device, consisting of a microfluidic chip and capillary, was developed to produce multicompartmental particles. By adjusting various parameters of the device, the size of the particles and the number of different compartments within the particle could be varied. These were used to encapsulate magnetic beads, fluorescent nanoparticles, and cells.







Abstract
A microfluidic assembly method based on a microfluidic chip and capillary device was developed to create multicompartmental particles. The microfluidic chip design endows the particles with regulable internal structure. By adjusting the microstructure of the chip, the diameter of the capillary, the gap length between the two microfluidic components, and the flow rates, the size of the particles and the number or the ratio of different regions within the particle could be widely varied. As a proof of concept, we have produced some complicated particles that even contain 20 compartments. Furthermore, the potential applications of the anisotropic particles are explored by encapsulating magnetic beads, fluorescent nanoparticles, and the cells into different compartments of the microparticles. We believe that this method will open new avenues for the design and application of multicompartmental particles.

&lt;p&gt;Mineral acids in hot pressurized water are able to dealkylate aromatic biorefinery products, as described by B.&#8197;U.&#8197;W. Maes et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913023). Ferulic acid obtained from rice bran, an agro&#8208;industry waste product, can be transformed into bio&#8208;catechol. Petrochemical catechol finds applications in the production of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, and polymers, hereby serving modern society.

      <title>Protein NMR Resonance Assignment without Spectral Analysis: 5D&#8201;SOlid&#8208;State Automated Projection SpectroscopY (SO&#8208;APSY)</title>
      <dc:description>
Protein spins in a new dimension: The correlation of five resonance frequencies of nuclear spins within one NMR experiment is now feasible for rapidly rotating protein solids by using projection spectroscopy. The dramatically reduced ambiguity means that the assignment of backbone resonances of proteins can be obtained automatically without the need for manual spectral analysis.







Abstract
Narrow proton signals, high sensitivity, and efficient coherence transfers provided by fast magic&#8208;angle spinning at high magnetic fields make automated projection spectroscopy feasible for the solid&#8208;state NMR analysis of proteins. We present the first ultrahigh dimensional implementation of this approach, where 5D peak lists are reconstructed from a number of 2D projections for protein samples of different molecular sizes and aggregation states, which show limited dispersion of chemical shifts or inhomogeneous broadenings. The resulting datasets are particularly suitable to automated analysis and yield rapid and unbiased assignments of backbone resonances.

      <title>Electrosynthesis of a Defective Indium Selenide with 3D&#8197;Structure on a Substrate for Tunable CO2 Electroreduction to Syngas</title>
      <dc:description>
Flower power: Electrosynthesized flower&#8208;like &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 with abundant defects and a 3D&#8197;structure on carbon paper (F&#8208;&#947;&#8208;In2Se3/CP) shows outstanding performance for the electroreduction of CO2 to syngas.







Abstract
Syngas (CO/H2) is a feedstock for the production of a variety of valuable chemicals and liquid fuels, and CO2 electrochemical reduction to syngas is very promising. However, the production of syngas with high efficiency is difficult. Herein, we show that defective indium selenide synthesized by an electrosynthesis method on carbon paper (&#947;&#8208;In2Se3/CP) is an extremely efficient electrocatalyst for this reaction. CO and H2 were the only products and the CO/H2 ratio could be tuned in a wide range by changing the applied potential or the composition of the electrolyte. In particular, using nanoflower&#8208;like &#947;&#8208;In2Se3/CP (F&#8208;&#947;&#8208;In2Se3/CP) as the electrode, the current density could be as high as 90.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a CO/H2 ratio of 1:1. In addition, the Faradaic efficiency of CO could reach 96.5&#8201;% with a current density of 55.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a very low overpotential of 220&#8197;mV. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of F&#8208;&#947;&#8208;In2Se3/CP can be attributed to its defect&#8208;rich 3D&#8197;structure and good contact with the CP substrate.

      <title>Measurement of Angstrom to Nanometer Molecular Distances with 19F Nuclear Spins by EPR/ENDOR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
What did the NO say to the 19F? Dipolar couplings between nitroxide spin labels and 19F nuclear spins report inter&#8208;spin distances in the range of &#8818;15&#8197;&#197; at sub&#8208;angstrom accuracy. These couplings are measured with sub&#8208;nanomole spin sensitivity by high frequency (94&#8197;GHz) electron&#8211;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and can be employed to obtain detailed structural insights into biomolecules.







Abstract
Spectroscopic and biophysical methods for structural determination at atomic resolution are fundamental in studies of biological function. Here we introduce an approach to measure molecular distances in bio&#8208;macromolecules using 19F nuclear spins and nitroxide radicals in combination with high&#8208;frequency (94&#8197;GHz/3.4&#8197;T) electron&#8211;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR). The small size and large gyromagnetic ratio of the 19F label enables to access distances up to about 1.5&#8197;nm with an accuracy of 0.1&#8211;1&#8197;&#197;. The experiment is not limited by the size of the bio&#8208;macromolecule. Performance is illustrated on synthesized fluorinated model compounds as well as spin&#8208;labelled RNA duplexes. The results demonstrate that our simple but strategic spin&#8208;labelling procedure combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopy accesses a distance range crucial to elucidate active sites of nucleic acids or proteins in the solution state.

      <title>Electrostatic Complementarity Drives Amyloid/Nucleic Acid Co&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Nucleic acids template amyloid assembly through electrostatic interactions. Structural insights indicate that these dynamic and complementary electrostatic interactions could play a role in the development of pathological lesions, bionanomaterials, and ribonucleoprotein granules.







Abstract
Proteinaceous plaques associated with neurodegenerative diseases contain many biopolymers including the polyanions glycosaminoglycans and nucleic acids. Polyanion&#8208;induced amyloid fibrillation has been implicated in disease etiology, but structural models for amyloid/nucleic acid co&#8208;assemblies remain limited. Here we constrain nucleic acid/peptide interactions with model peptides that exploit electrostatic complementarity and define a novel amyloid/nucleic acid co&#8208;assembly. The structure provides a model for nucleic acid/amyloid co&#8208;assembly as well as insight into the energetic determinants involved in templating amyloid assembly.

      <title>Topochemical Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphides Using Phosphorene Templates</title>
      <dc:description>
Material gains: A general bottom&#8208;up topochemical strategy has been developed to synthesize solution&#8208;processable two&#8208;dimensional transition&#8208;metal phosphides, which exhibit semiconducting features and superior activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction. Notably, Co2P is a p&#8208;type semiconductor, with a hole mobility of 20.8&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K in field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as a fascinating class of narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors and electrocatalysts. However, they are intrinsic nonlayered materials that cannot be delaminated into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) sheets. Here, we demonstrate a general bottom&#8208;up topochemical strategy to synthesize a series of 2D TMPs (e.g. Co2P, Ni12P5, and CoxFe2&#8722;xP) by using phosphorene sheets as the phosphorus precursors and 2D templates. Notably, 2D Co2P is a p&#8208;type semiconductor, with a hole mobility of 20.8&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K in field&#8208;effect transistors. It also behaves as a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thanks to the charge&#8208;transport modulation and improved surface exposure. In particular, iron&#8208;doped Co2P (i.e. Co1.5Fe0.5P) delivers a low overpotential of only 278&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 that outperforms the commercial Ir/C benchmark (304&#8197;mV).

      <title>Thiophenylazobenzene: An Alternative Photoisomerization Controlled by Lone&#8208;Pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>
My own way: Thiophenylazobenzene is a sulfur&#8208;based azoheteroarene photoswitch with impressive fatigue resistance, photoisomerization efficiency, and highly selective photoconversion. Its (Z)&#8208;isomer adopts an unusual orthogonal geometry stabilized by an intramolecular lone&#8208;pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction governing the ultrafast photoisomerization, which requires a mechanism involving significant movement along the inversion reaction coordinate.







Abstract
Azoheteroarene photoswitches have attracted attention due to their unique properties. We present the stationary photochromism and ultrafast photoisomerization mechanism of thiophenylazobenzene (TphAB). It demonstrates impressive fatigue resistance and photoisomerization efficiency, and shows favorably separated (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;isomer absorption bands, allowing for highly selective photoconversion. The (Z)&#8208;isomer of TphAB adopts an unusual orthogonal geometry where the thiophenyl group is perfectly perpendicular to the phenyl group. This geometry is stabilized by a rare lone&#8208;pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between the S atom and the phenyl group. The photoisomerization of TphAB occurs on the sub&#8208;ps to ps timescale and is governed by this interaction. Therefore, the adoption and disruption of the orthogonal geometry requires significant movement along the inversion reaction coordinates (CNN and NNC angles). Our results establish TphAB as an excellent photoswitch with versatile properties that expand the application possibilities of AB derivatives.

      <title>Polar&#8208;Functionalized, Crosslinkable, Self&#8208;Healing, and Photoresponsive Polyolefins</title>
      <dc:description>
Going polar: An efficient route is reported to generate polar&#8208;functionalized, crosslinkable, self&#8208;healing, and photoresponsive polyolefins with thermoplastic, elastomeric, and thermosetting properties.







Abstract
The nonpolar nature of polyolefins is one of their biggest limitations. Now, an efficient route to generate polar&#8208;functionalized, crosslinkable, self&#8208;healing, photoresponsive polyolefins with thermoplastic, elastomeric, and thermosetting properties is reported. Tunable amounts of carboxylic acid and a cyclic comonomer are installed onto polyolefins by palladium&#8208;catalyzed terpolymerization reactions. The incorporated carboxylic acid unit can alter the surface properties of polyolefins. The subsequently introduced Fe3+/citric acid combination induces dynamic crosslinking and enables self&#8208;healing. Under UV light irradiation, citric acid reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+ and decreases the crosslinking density. The Fe2+ moiety can be easily oxidized back to Fe3+, making the process reversible at the expense of citric acid. The incorporated cyclic comonomer modulates the crystallinity of polyolefins, provides elastic properties, and installs carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds for sulfur&#8208;induced vulcanization.

      <title>&#8220;Direct&#8221; 13C Hyperpolarization of 13C&#8208;Acetate by MicroTesla NMR Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE)</title>
      <dc:description>
Give it to me straight: Addition of metabolically relevant 13C&#8208;acetate and parahydrogen to solutions containing activated catalyst gives rise to enhancement of 13C&#8197;NMR signals by up to &#8776;100&#8208;fold at 9.4&#8197;T. The hyper&#8208;polarization is shown to proceed directly, unlike previous efforts that have required either synthesis of catalyst&#8208;binding composite structures, and/or the indirect relay of spin order through other species.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate &#8220;direct&#8221; 13C hyperpolarization of 13C&#8208;acetate via signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE). The standard SABRE homogeneous catalyst [Ir&#8208;IMes; [IrCl(COD)(IMes)], (IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl), imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; COD=cyclooctadiene)] was first activated in the presence of an auxiliary substrate (pyridine) in alcohol. Following addition of sodium 1&#8208;13C&#8208;acetate, parahydrogen bubbling within a microtesla magnetic field (i.e. under conditions of SABRE in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei, SABRE&#8208;SHEATH) resulted in positive enhancements of up to &#8776;100&#8208;fold in the 13C&#8197;NMR signal compared to thermal equilibrium at 9.4&#8197;T. The present results are consistent with a mechanism of &#8220;direct&#8221; transfer of spin order from parahydrogen to 13C spins of acetate weakly bound to the catalyst, under conditions of fast exchange with respect to the 13C acetate resonance, but we find that relaxation dynamics at microtesla fields alter the optimal matching from the traditional SABRE&#8208;SHEATH picture. Further development of this approach could lead to new ways to rapidly, cheaply, and simply hyperpolarize a broad range of substrates (e.g. metabolites with carboxyl groups) for various applications, including biomedical NMR and MRI of cellular and in vivo metabolism.

The standard SABRE homogeneous catalyst [Ir&#8208;IMes; [IrCl(COD)(IMes)], (IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl), imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; COD=cyclooctadiene)] was first activated in the presence of an auxiliary substrate (pyridine) in alcohol. Following addition of sodium 1&#8208;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8208;acetate, parahydrogen bubbling within a microtesla magnetic field (i.e. under conditions of SABRE in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei, SABRE&#8208;SHEATH) resulted in positive enhancements of up to &#8776;100&#8208;fold in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8197;NMR signal compared to thermal equilibrium at 9.4&#8197;T. The present results are consistent with a mechanism of &#8220;direct&#8221; transfer of spin order from parahydrogen to &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C spins of acetate weakly bound to the catalyst, under conditions of fast exchange with respect to the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C acetate resonance, but we find that relaxation dynamics at microtesla fields alter the optimal matching from the traditional SABRE&#8208;SHEATH picture. Further development of this approach could lead to new ways to rapidly, cheaply, and simply hyperpolarize a broad range of substrates (e.g. metabolites with carboxyl groups) for various applications, including biomedical NMR and MRI of cellular and in vivo metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conversion of Mg&#8208;Li Bimetallic Alloys to Magnesium Alkoxide and Magnesium Oxide Ceramic Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
Bulk Mg&#8208;Li alloys were transformed into Mg alkoxide NWs without the use of catalysts, templates, expensive or toxic chemicals or external stimuli. The NWs can be converted in air into ceramic MgO NWs with similar dimensions. The impact of alloy grain size and Li content, temperature, inductive and steric effects of alkoxide groups on the diameter, length, composition, ductility and oxidation of the NWs is discussed.







Abstract
Technologically important composites with enhanced thermal and mechanical properties rely on the reinforcement by the high specific strength ceramic nanofibers or nanowires (NWs) with high aspect ratios. However, conventional synthesis routes to produce such ceramic NWs have prohibitively high cost. Now, direct transformation of bulk Mg&#8208;Li alloys into Mg alkoxide NWs is demonstrated without the use of catalysts, templates, expensive or toxic chemicals, or any external stimuli. This mechanism proceeds through the minimization of strain energy at the boundary of phase transformation front leading to the formation of ultra&#8208;long NWs with tunable dimensions. Such alkoxide NWs can be easily converted in air into ceramic MgO NWs with similar dimensions. The impact of the alloy grain size and Li content, synthesis temperature, inductive and steric effects of alkoxide groups on the diameter, length, composition, ductility, and oxidation of the produced NWs is discussed.

Abstract
The synthesis of structurally complex and highly strained natural products provides unique challenges and unexpected opportunities for the development of new reactions and strategies. Herein, the synthesis of (+)&#8208;[5]&#8208;ladderanoic acid is reported. En route to the target, unusual and unexpected strain release driven transformations were uncovered.

      <title>Acyl Migration versus Epoxidation in Gold Catalysis: Facile, Switchable, and Atom&#8208;Economic Synthesis of Acylindoles and Quinoline Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
The golden touch: Catalyst&#8208;controlled, tunable [3+2] and [4+2] annulations were devised for the synthesis of acylindoles and quinoline derivatives. Six divergent compound classes&#8212;including 6&#8208;acylindoles 3, 5&#8208;acylindoles 4, quinoline oxides 5, 3&#8208;hydroxylquinolines 6, quinolin&#8208;3(4H)&#8208;ones 7, and a polycyclic compound&#8212;were synthesized from anthranils 1 and ynamides 2 by selective acyl migration and epoxide formation via &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediates.







Abstract
We report a switchable synthesis of acylindoles and quinoline derivatives via gold&#8208;catalyzed annulations of anthranils and ynamides. &#945;&#8208;Imino gold carbenes, generated in&#8197;situ from anthranils and an N,O&#8208;coordinated gold(III) catalyst, undergo electrophilic attack to the aryl &#960;&#8208;bond, followed by unexpected and highly selective 1,4&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;acyl migrations to form 6&#8208;acylindoles or 5&#8208;acylindoles. With the (2&#8208;biphenyl)di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine (JohnPhos) ligand, gold(I) carbenes experienced carbene/carbonyl additions to deliver quinoline oxides. Some of these epoxides are valuable substrates for the preparation of 3&#8208;hydroxylquinolines, quinolin&#8208;3(4H)&#8208;ones, and polycyclic compounds via facile in&#8197;situ rearrangements. The reaction can be efficiently conducted on a gram scale and the obtained products are valuable substrates for preparing other potentially useful compounds. A computational study explained the unexpected selectivities and the dependency of the reaction pathway on the oxidation state and ligands of gold. With gold(III) the barrier for the formation of the strained oxirane ring is too high; whereas with gold(I) this transition state becomes accessible. Furthermore, energetic barriers to migration of the substituents on the intermediate sigma&#8208;complexes support the observed substitution pattern in the final product.

      <title>Nanographenes: Ultrastable, Switchable, and Bright Probes for Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
As a new class of fluorophores introduced for super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy, nanographenes exhibit outstanding photophysical properties: high brightness, intrinsic blinking even in air, excellent fluorescence recovery, and stability over several months. As a proof of concept for super&#8208;resolution applications, 3D super&#8208;resolution images of silica nanocracks were recorded with nanographene as the probe.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy has enabled important breakthroughs in biology and materials science. Implementations such as single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) and minimal emission fluxes (MINFLUX) microscopy in the localization mode exploit fluorophores that blink, i.e., switch on and off, stochastically. Here, we introduce nanographenes, namely large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that can also be regarded as atomically precise graphene quantum dots, as a new class of fluorophores for super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. Nanographenes exhibit outstanding photophysical properties: intrinsic blinking even in air, excellent fluorescence recovery, and stability over several months. As a proof of concept for super&#8208;resolution applications, we use nanographenes in SMLM to generate 3D super&#8208;resolution images of silica nanocracks. Our findings open the door for the widespread application of nanographenes in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As a new class of fluorophores&lt;/b&gt; introduced for super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy, nanographenes exhibit outstanding photophysical properties: high brightness, intrinsic blinking even in air, excellent fluorescence recovery, and stability over several months. As a proof of concept for super&#8208;resolution applications, 3D super&#8208;resolution images of silica nanocracks were recorded with nanographene as the probe.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy has enabled important breakthroughs in biology and materials science. Implementations such as single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) and minimal emission fluxes (MINFLUX) microscopy in the localization mode exploit fluorophores that blink, i.e., switch on and off, stochastically. Here, we introduce nanographenes, namely large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that can also be regarded as atomically precise graphene quantum dots, as a new class of fluorophores for super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. Nanographenes exhibit outstanding photophysical properties: intrinsic blinking even in air, excellent fluorescence recovery, and stability over several months. As a proof of concept for super&#8208;resolution applications, we use nanographenes in SMLM to generate 3D super&#8208;resolution images of silica nanocracks. Our findings open the door for the widespread application of nanographenes in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The aromatic nitrogen atoms of heteroarylaldehydes are activated by carbene catalysts to react with ketone electrophiles. Multi&#8208;functionalized cyclic N,O&#8208;acetal products are afforded in good to excellent yields and optical purities. Our reaction involves the formation of an unprecedented aza&#8208;fulvene&#8208;type acylazolium intermediate. A broad range of N&#8208;heteroaromatic aldehydes and electron&#8208;deficient ketone substrates works effectively in this transformation. Several of the chiral N,O&#8208;acetal products afforded through this protocol exhibit excellent antibacterial activities against Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs) and are valuable in the development of novel agrichemicals for plant protection.

      <title>Total Synthesis of Talatisamine</title>
      <dc:description>
The highly oxidized and intricately fused hexacyclic structure (ABCDEF&#8208;ring) of talatisamine with 12 contiguous stereocenters presents a formidable challenge for chemical construction. An efficient strategy, in which the entire hexacycle is assembled from a chiral AE&#8208;ring fragment and an aromatic D&#8208;ring, led to the total synthesis of talatisamine in 33 steps from 2&#8208;cyclohexenone.







Abstract
Talatisamine (1) is a member of the C19&#8208;diterpenoid alkaloid family, and exhibits K+ channel inhibitory and antiarrhythmic activities. The formidable synthetic challenge that 1 presents is due to its highly oxidized and intricately fused hexacyclic 6/7/5/6/6/5&#8208;membered&#8208;ring structure (ABCDEF&#8208;ring) with 12 contiguous stereocenters. Here we report an efficient synthetic route to 1 by the assembly of two structurally simple fragments, chiral 6/6&#8208;membered AE&#8208;ring 7 and aromatic 6&#8208;membered D&#8208;ring 6. AE&#8208;ring 7 was constructed from 2&#8208;cyclohexenone (8) through fusing an N&#8208;ethylpiperidine ring by a double Mannich reaction. After coupling 6 with 7, an oxidative dearomatization/Diels&#8211;Alder reaction sequence generated fused pentacycle 4&#8201;b. The newly formed 6/6&#8208;membered ring system was then stereospecifically reorganized into the 7/5&#8208;membered BC&#8208;ring of 3 via a Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement. Finally, Hg(OAc)2 induced an oxidative aza&#8208;Prins cyclization of 2, thereby forging the remaining 5&#8208;membered F&#8208;ring. The total synthesis of 1 was thus accomplished by optimizing and orchestrating 33 transformations from 8.

      <title>A 3.3&#8197;&#197;&#8208;Resolution Structure of Hyperthermophilic Respiratory Complex&#8197;III Reveals the Mechanism of Its Thermal Stability</title>
      <dc:description>
A hot take on thermophiles: The hyperstability of respiratory complex&#8197;III from Aquifex aeolicus provides a suitable environment for the internal electron transfer reaction at high temperature.







Abstract
Respiratory chain complexes convert energy by coupling electron flow to transmembrane proton translocation. Owing to a lack of atomic structures of cytochrome&#8197;bc1 complex (Complex&#8197;III) from thermophilic bacteria, little is known about the adaptations of this macromolecular machine to hyperthermophilic environments. In this study, we purified the cytochrome&#8197;bc1 complex of Aquifex aeolicus, one of the most extreme thermophilic bacteria known, and determined its structure with and without an inhibitor at 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution. Several residues unique for thermophilic bacteria were detected that provide additional stabilization for the structure. An extra transmembrane helix at the N&#8208;terminus of cyt.&#8201;c1 was found to greatly enhance the interaction between cyt.&#8201;b and cyt.&#8201;c1, and to bind a phospholipid molecule to stabilize the complex in the membrane. These results provide the structural basis for the hyperstability of the cytochrome&#8197;bc1 complex in an extreme thermal environment.

      <title>Self&#8208;Immolative Activation of &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase&#8208;Responsive Probes for In Vivo MR Imaging in Mouse Models</title>
      <dc:description>
For in vivo detection of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity in mammals the imaging agent was injected intraperitoneally into transgenic LacZ mice and global signal enhancement was observed 1&#8197;h post injection. At 24&#8197;h, the MR signal returned to baseline suggesting that the agent is cleared renally. No signal enhancement is observed in non&#8208;transgenic native control mice.







Abstract
Our lab has developed a new series of self&#8208;immolative MR agents for the rapid detection of enzyme activity in mouse models expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal). We investigated two molecular architectures to create agents that detect &#946;&#8208;gal activity by modulating the coordination of water to GdIII. The first is an intermolecular approach, wherein we designed several structural isomers to maximize coordination of endogenous carbonate ions. The second involves an intramolecular mechanism for q modulation. We incorporated a pendant coordinating carboxylate ligand with a 2, 4, 6, or 8 carbon linker to saturate ligand coordination to the GdIII ion. This renders the agent ineffective. We show that one agent in particular (6&#8208;C pendant carboxylate) is an extremely effective MR reporter for the detection of enzyme activity in a mouse model expressing &#946;&#8208;gal.

      <dc:description>
Sweet!

This redesigned C&#8211;N lyase displayed a remarkable 1140&#8208;fold increase in activity for selective hydroamination of fumarate.







Abstract
Aspartic acid derivatives with branched N&#8208;alkyl or N&#8208;arylalkyl substituents are valuable precursors to artificial dipeptide sweeteners such as neotame and advantame. The development of a biocatalyst to synthesize these compounds in a single asymmetric step is an as yet unmet challenge. Reported here is an enantioselective biocatalytic synthesis of various difficult N&#8208;substituted aspartic acids, including N&#8208;(3,3&#8208;dimethylbutyl)&#8208;l&#8208;aspartic acid and N&#8208;[3&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)propyl]&#8208;l&#8208;aspartic acid, precursors to neotame and advantame, respectively, using an engineered variant of ethylenediamine&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;disuccinic acid (EDDS) lyase from Chelativorans sp. BNC1. This engineered C&#8211;N lyase (mutant D290M/Y320M) displayed a remarkable 1140&#8208;fold increase in activity for the selective hydroamination of fumarate compared to that of the wild&#8208;type enzyme. These results present new opportunities to develop practical multienzymatic processes for the more sustainable and step&#8208;economic synthesis of an important class of food additives.

      <title>Hot Branching Dynamics in a Light&#8208;Harvesting Iron Carbene Complex Revealed by Ultrafast X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
An iron(II) NHC complex was studied by sub&#8208;picosecond X&#8208;ray spectroscopy to identify and quantify the states involved in the deactivation cascade after light absorption. After population of a hot 3MLCT state, 30&#8201;% of the molecules undergo an ultrafast relaxation to the 3MC state, in competition with a slower parallel pathway over the relaxed 3MLCT state.







Abstract
Iron N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have received a great deal of attention recently because of their growing potential as light sensitizers or photocatalysts. We present a sub&#8208;ps X&#8208;ray spectroscopy study of an FeIINHC complex that identifies and quantifies the states involved in the deactivation cascade after light absorption. Excited molecules relax back to the ground state along two pathways: After population of a hot 3MLCT state, from the initially excited 1MLCT state, 30&#8201;% of the molecules undergo ultrafast (150&#8197;fs) relaxation to the 3MC state, in competition with vibrational relaxation and cooling to the relaxed 3MLCT state. The relaxed 3MLCT state then decays much more slowly (7.6&#8197;ps) to the 3MC state. The 3MC state is rapidly (2.2&#8197;ps) deactivated to the ground state. The 5MC state is not involved in the deactivation pathway. The ultrafast partial deactivation of the 3MLCT state constitutes a loss channel from the point of view of photochemical efficiency and highlights the necessity to screen transition&#8208;metal complexes for similar ultrafast decays to optimize photochemical performance.

      <title>Chameleon Metals: Autonomous Nano&#8208;Texturing and Composition Inversion on Liquid Metals Surfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Chameleon metals: Metal passivating oxide layer is a complex pseudo&#8208;equilibrium system with a plethora of undiscovered features. Here, the complexity of this thin oxide layer is exploited to engineer surface design and structure, resulting in the formation of compositionally inverted surface features and nano&#8208;scale fractal&#8208;like designs.







Abstract
Studies on passivating oxides on liquid metals are challenging, in part, due to plasticity, entropic, and technological limitations. In alloys, compositional complexity in the passivating oxide(s) and underlying metal interface exacerbates these challenges. This nanoscale complexity, however, offers an opportunity to engineer the surface of the liquid metal under felicitous choice of processing conditions. We inferred that difference in reactivity, coupled with inherent interface ordering, presages exploitable order and selectivity to autonomously present compositionally biased oxides on the surface of these metals. Besides compositional differences, sequential release of biased (enriched) components, via fractal&#8208;like paths, allows for patterned layered surface structures. We, therefore, present a simple thermal&#8208;oxidative compositional inversion (TOCI) method to introduce fractal&#8208;like structures on the surface of these metals in a controlled (tier, composition, and structure) manner by exploiting underlying stochastic fracturing process. Using a ternary alloy, a three&#8208;tiered (in structure and composition) surface structure is demonstrated.

      <title>Imaging Cell&#8208;Matrix Adhesions and Collective Migration of Living Cells by Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) with surface sensitivity was demonstrated to reveal cell&#8208;matrix adhesions of single cells cultured on nanoporous electrode surfaces, as well as their dynamic variation and strength. This approach was further used for imaging cell&#8208;matrix adhesions of an advancing cell sheet to study the moving tendency of cells in collective migration.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;matrix adhesions play essential roles in a variety of biological processes. Herein, we report a label&#8208;free method to map cell&#8208;matrix adhesions of single living cells on an electrode surface by electrochemiluminescence (ECL). An indium tin oxide electrode modified with a silica nanochannel membrane was used as the substrate electrode, at which the ECL generation from freely diffusing luminophores provided a distinct visual contrast between adhesion sites and noncontacted domains, thus selectively revealing the former in a label&#8208;free manner. With this methodology, we studied the spatial distribution, as well as dynamic variation, of cell&#8208;matrix adhesions and the adhesion strength at the subcellular level. Cell&#8208;matrix adhesions of an advancing cell sheet were finally imaged to study the movement of cells in collective migration. A statistical analysis suggests that cells on the far side of leading edge also have the propensity to migrate and do not act as just passive followers.

      <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Polymeric Carbon Nitride Colloidal Nanoparticles for Highly Selective Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Photocatalysis
</title>
      <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;modus: Water&#8208;soluble colloidal nanoparticles of polymeric carbon nitride enable quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalysis with unprecedented performance. The dissolved photocatalyst can be easily recovered and re&#8208;dissolved by simple modulation of the ionic strength of the medium, retaining its excellent activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Heptazine&#8208;based polymeric carbon nitrides (PCN) are promising photocatalysts for light&#8208;driven redox transformations. However, their activity is hampered by low surface area resulting in low concentration of accessible active sites. Herein, we report a bottom&#8208;up preparation of PCN nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution (ca. 10&#177;3&#8197;nm), which are fully soluble in water showing no gelation or precipitation over several months. They allow photocatalysis to be carried out under quasi&#8208;homogeneous conditions. The superior performance of water&#8208;soluble PCN, compared to conventional solid PCN, is shown in photocatalytic H2O2 production via reduction of oxygen accompanied by highly selective photooxidation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol or lignocellulose&#8208;derived feedstock (ethanol, glycerol, glucose). The dissolved photocatalyst can be easily recovered and re&#8208;dissolved by simple modulation of the ionic strength of the medium, without any loss of activity and selectivity.

Herein, we report a bottom&#8208;up preparation of PCN nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution (ca. 10&#177;3&#8197;nm), which are fully soluble in water showing no gelation or precipitation over several months. They allow photocatalysis to be carried out under quasi&#8208;homogeneous conditions. The superior performance of water&#8208;soluble PCN, compared to conventional solid PCN, is shown in photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production via reduction of oxygen accompanied by highly selective photooxidation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol or lignocellulose&#8208;derived feedstock (ethanol, glycerol, glucose). The dissolved photocatalyst can be easily recovered and re&#8208;dissolved by simple modulation of the ionic strength of the medium, without any loss of activity and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of the Iodide&#8211;Methylammonium Interaction in the Ferroelectricity of CH3NH3PbI3</title>
      <dc:description>
Cause and effect: Although the question of the ferroelectricity of CH3NH3PbI3 is of essential importance for understanding its performance, it has long been disputed. Insight into the crystallographic origin of the breaking of the inversion symmetry in the structure, a necessary prerequisite for ferroelectricity, is now provided.







Abstract
Excellent conversion efficiencies of over 20&#8201;% and facile cell production have placed hybrid perovskites at the forefront of novel solar cell materials, with CH3NH3PbI3 being an archetypal compound. The question why CH3NH3PbI3 has such extraordinary characteristics, particularly a very efficient power conversion from absorbed light to electrical power, is hotly debated, with ferroelectricity being a promising candidate. This does, however, require the crystal structure to be non&#8208;centrosymmetric and we herein present crystallographic evidence as to how the symmetry breaking occurs on a crystallographic and, therefore, long&#8208;range level. Although the molecular cation CH3NH3+ is intrinsically polar, it is heavily disordered and this cannot be the sole reason for the ferroelectricity. We show that it, nonetheless, plays an important role, as it distorts the neighboring iodide positions from their centrosymmetric positions.

      <title>Electrochemistry Broadens the Scope of Flavin Photocatalysis: Photoelectrocatalytic Oxidation of Unactivated Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Dynamic duo: The combination of electrochemistry and photochemistry allows the generation of highly reactive catalytic intermediates without the need for a chemical oxidant. This photoelectrocatalytic strategy thus accessed the elusive reactivity of flavins for oxidizing unactivated aliphatic alcohols. HAT=hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.







Abstract
Riboflavin&#8208;derived photocatalysts have been extensively studied in the context of alcohol oxidation. However, to date, the scope of this catalytic methodology has been limited to benzyl alcohols. In this work, mechanistic understanding of flavin&#8208;catalyzed oxidation reactions, in either the absence or presence of thiourea as a cocatalyst, was obtained. The mechanistic insights enabled development of an electrochemically driven photochemical oxidation of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols using a pair of flavin and dialkylthiourea catalysts. Electrochemistry makes it possible to avoid using O2 and an oxidant and generating H2O2 as a byproduct, both of which oxidatively degrade thiourea under the reaction conditions. This modification unlocks a new mechanistic pathway in which the oxidation of unactivated alcohols is achieved by thiyl radical mediated hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction.

      <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis in the presence of transition metals is a challenge because of the high affinity of NHCs for metals. In their Communication on page&#8197;161, J. Mao, P.&#8197;J. Walsh, and co&#8208;workers present a system for the conjugate addition of aryl iodides to enals through cooperative catalysis between an NHC and a Pd catalyst. The catalytic cycles intersect at Pd, where the two newly formed Pd&#8722;C bonds undergo reductive elimination to give a C&#8722;C bond.

The catalytic cycles intersect at Pd, where the two newly formed Pd&#8722;C bonds undergo reductive elimination to give a C&#8722;C bond.

      <title>Perovskite Oxide Based Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Among the most important classes of materials for the application as electrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting are perovskite oxides. In this Review, recent progress about the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite oxide based electrodes for PEC water splitting is discussed. The design strategies, challenges and perspectives of perovskite oxides as electrodes for PEC water splitting are also presented.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive strategy for the large&#8208;scale production of renewable hydrogen from water. Developing cost&#8208;effective, active and stable semiconducting photoelectrodes is extremely important for achieving PEC water splitting with high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency. Perovskite oxides as a large family of semiconducting metal oxides are extensively investigated as electrodes in PEC water splitting owing to their abundance, high (photo)electrochemical stability, compositional and structural flexibility allowing the achievement of high electrocatalytic activity, superior sunlight absorption capability and precise control and tuning of band gaps and band edges. In this review, the research progress in the design, development, and application of perovskite oxides in PEC water splitting is summarized, with a special emphasis placed on understanding the relationship between the composition/structure and (photo)electrochemical activity.

      <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions Between Aromatic Groups in Amphiphilic Molecules: Directing Hierarchical Growth of Porous Zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>
Growth opportunity: Aromatic segments such as biphenyl, naphthyl, azobenzene, benzene, and 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene, which have strong interactions with each other in a hydrophobic chain, were introduced to the tail of an alkyl chain. The rigid segments self&#8208;assemble to form hydrophobic centers with an ordered orientation, blocking zeolite crystal growth and geometrically matching the zeolite framework. Appended quaternary ammonium groups direct the zeolite formation.







Abstract
The development of hierarchical macro&#8208; or mesoporous zeolites is essential in zeolite synthesis because the size of the micropores limits mass transport and their use as industrial catalysts for bulky molecules.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Growth opportunity&lt;/b&gt;: Aromatic segments such as biphenyl, naphthyl, azobenzene, benzene, and 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene, which have strong interactions with each other in a hydrophobic chain, were introduced to the tail of an alkyl chain. The rigid segments self&#8208;assemble to form hydrophobic centers with an ordered orientation, blocking zeolite crystal growth and geometrically matching the zeolite framework. Appended quaternary ammonium groups direct the zeolite formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of hierarchical macro&#8208; or mesoporous zeolites is essential in zeolite synthesis because the size of the micropores limits mass transport and their use as industrial catalysts for bulky molecules. Although major breakthroughs have been achieved, fabricating crystallographically ordered mesoporous zeolites using a templating strategy is still an unsolved challenge. This minireview highlights our recent efforts on the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic molecules to obtain ordered hierarchical MFI zeolites by introducing aromatic groups into the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphilic molecules. Owing to the geometric matching between the self&#8208;assembled aromatic tails and the MFI framework, a)&#8197;single&#8208;crystalline mesostructured zeolite nanosheets (SCZNs), b)&#8197;SCZNs with a 90&#176; rotational intergrowth structure, c)&#8197;a hierarchical MFI zeolite with a two&#8208;dimensional square &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;4&lt;i&gt;mm&lt;/i&gt; mesostructure, and d)&#8197;a single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous ZSM&#8208;5 with three&#8208;dimensional pores and sheetlike mesopores layered along the &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;axis were successfully synthesized.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Persistent Radical Effect in Organic Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
The &#8220;persistent radical effect&#8221; (PRE) is a kinetic phenomenon explaining the high cross&#8208;selectivity of radical&#8211;radical couplings. If two radicals with different lifetimes are generated at equal rates, the longer&#8208;lived (persistent) radical will be accumulated in comparison to the short&#8208;lived radical, resulting in a high cross&#8208;coupling selectivity. Importantly, radical metal species also act as persistent coupling partners.







Abstract
Radical&#8211;radical couplings are mostly nearly diffusion&#8208;controlled processes. Therefore, the selective cross&#8208;coupling of two different radicals is challenging and not a synthetically valuable transformation. However, if the radicals have different lifetimes and if they are generated at equal rates, cross&#8208;coupling will become the dominant process. This high cross&#8208;selectivity is based on a kinetic phenomenon called the persistent radical effect (PRE). In this Review, an explanation of the PRE supported by simulations of simple model systems is provided. Radical stabilities are discussed within the context of their lifetimes, and various examples of PRE&#8208;mediated radical&#8211;radical couplings in synthesis are summarized. It is shown that the PRE is not restricted to the coupling of a persistent with a transient radical. If one coupling partner is longer&#8208;lived than the other transient radical, the PRE operates and high cross&#8208;selectivity is achieved. This important point expands the scope of PRE&#8208;mediated radical chemistry. The Review is divided into two parts, namely 1)&#8197;the coupling of persistent or longer&#8208;lived organic radicals and 2)&#8197;&#8220;radical&#8211;metal crossover reactions&#8221;; here, metal&#8208;centered radical species and more generally longer&#8208;lived transition&#8208;metal complexes that are able to react with radicals are discussed&#8212;a field that has flourished recently.

      <title>Integration of Graphite and Silicon Anodes for the Commercialization of High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Why graphite and Si? The practical realization of Si anodes is still a big challenge, but the co&#8208;utilization of graphite and Si could solve this. This Review provides insight into the commercialization of Si anodes, emphasizing the necessity for the co&#8208;utilization of graphite and Si and the development of graphite/Si anodes as well as giving a detailed discussion on their electrochemical behavior and critical factors.







Abstract
Silicon is considered a most promising anode material for overcoming the theoretical capacity limit of carbonaceous anodes. The use of nanomethods has led to significant progress being made with Si anodes to address the severe volume change during (de)lithiation. However, less progress has been made in the practical application of Si anodes in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The drastic increase in the energy demands of diverse industries has led to the co&#8208;utilization of Si and graphite resurfacing as a commercially viable method for realizing high energy. Herein, we highlight the necessity for the co&#8208;utilization of graphite and Si for commercialization and discuss the development of graphite/Si anodes. Representative Si anodes used in graphite&#8208;blended electrodes are covered and a variety of strategies for building graphite/Si composites are organized according to their synthetic methods. The criteria for the co&#8208;utilization of graphite and Si are systematically presented. Finally, we provide suggestions for the commercialization of graphite/Si combinations.

      <title>Stereoselective Csp3&#8722;Csp2 Cross&#8208;Couplings of Chiral Secondary Alkylzinc Reagents with Alkenyl and Aryl Halides</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral couplings made easy: Chiral secondary alkylzinc reagents undergo stereoselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with alkenyl and aryl halides. These chiral mixed dialkylzincs are configurationally stable at room temperature for several hours. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the overall retention in the catalytic cycle.

Abstract
We report palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of chiral secondary non&#8208;stabilized dialkylzinc reagents, prepared from readily available chiral secondary alkyl iodides, with alkenyl and aryl halides. This method provides &#945;&#8208;chiral alkenes and arenes with very high retention of configuration (dr up to 98:2) and satisfactory overall yields (up to 76&#8201;% for 3 reaction steps). The configurational stability of these chiral non&#8208;stabilized dialkylzinc reagents was determined and exceeded several hours at 25&#8201;&#176;C. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the stereoretention during the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, the cross&#8208;coupling reaction was applied in an efficient total synthesis of the sesquiterpenes (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;curcumene with control of the absolute stereochemistry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of chiral secondary non&#8208;stabilized dialkylzinc reagents, prepared from readily available chiral secondary alkyl iodides, with alkenyl and aryl halides. This method provides &#945;&#8208;chiral alkenes and arenes with very high retention of configuration (dr up to 98:2) and satisfactory overall yields (up to 76&#8201;% for 3 reaction steps). The configurational stability of these chiral non&#8208;stabilized dialkylzinc reagents was determined and exceeded several hours at 25&#8201;&#176;C. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the stereoretention during the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, the cross&#8208;coupling reaction was applied in an efficient total synthesis of the sesquiterpenes (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208; and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;curcumene with control of the absolute stereochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Triboration of Terminal Alkynes Using B2pin2: Efficient Synthesis of 1,1,2&#8208;Triborylalkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Three boron groups in one step: A straightforward copper&#8208;catalyzed triboration of terminal alkynes gives access to triborylalkenes by sequential dehydroborylation and diboration. The triborylalkene products were applied in the synthesis of multisubstituted olefins with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We report herein the catalytic triboration of terminal alkynes with B2pin2 (bis(pinacolato)diboron) using readily available Cu(OAc)2 and PnBu3. Various 1,1,2&#8208;triborylalkenes, a class of compounds that have been demonstrated to be potential matrix metalloproteinase (MMP&#8208;2) inhibitors, were obtained directly in moderate to good yields. The process features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. This copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction can be conducted on a gram scale to produce the corresponding 1,1,2&#8208;triborylalkenes in modest yields. The utility of these products was demonstrated by further transformations of the C&#8722;B bonds to prepare gem&#8208;dihaloborylalkenes (F, Cl, Br), monohaloborylalkenes (Cl, Br), and trans&#8208;diaryldiborylalkenes, which serve as important synthons and have previously been challenging to prepare.

      <dc:description>
It takes two: Synergistic catalysis between NHC and palladium catalysts enables the conjugate addition of aryl iodides to enals under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. This method circumvents the use of moisture&#8208;sensitive organometallic reagents, and a diverse array of functional groups such as esters, nitriles, alcohols, and heterocycles are tolerated.







Abstract
An umpolung 1,4&#8208;addition of aryl iodides to enals promoted by cooperative (terpy)Pd/NHC catalysis was developed that generates various bioactive &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl propanoate derivatives. This system is not only the first reported palladium&#8208;catalyzed arylation of NHC&#8208;bound homoenolates but also expands the scope of NHC&#8208;induced umpolung transformations. A diverse array of functional groups such as esters, nitriles, alcohols, and heterocycles are tolerated under the mild conditions.

      <title>The Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of Ketones: Disclosing the Macrocylic Privilege</title>
      <dc:description>
In good shape: A manganese(I) complex containing a chiral (NH)2P2 macrocycle catalyzes the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of a broad scope of ketones with the highest enantioselectivities obtained with this metal thus far. Noncovalent interactions between the incoming substrate and the macrocyclic ligand account for the excellent enantioselection.







Abstract
The bis(carbonyl) manganese(I) complex [Mn(CO)2(1)]Br (2) with a chiral (NH)2P2 macrocyclic ligand (1) catalyzes the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of polar double bonds with 2&#8208;propanol as the hydrogen source. Ketones (43 substrates) are reduced to alcohols in high yields (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). A stereochemical model based on attractive CH&#8211;&#960; interactions is proposed.

      <title>An Activatable NIR&#8208;II Nanoprobe for In&#8197;Vivo Early Real&#8208;Time Diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
      <dc:description>
TBI TBD: A targeted activatable NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (V&amp;A@Ag2S) that specifically lights up the traumatic brain injury (TBI) regions is presented. The nanoprobe response is based on the prodromal biomarker peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;)&#8208;triggered fluorescence recovery, providing a favorable approach for in&#8197;vivo early real&#8208;time assessment of TBI.







Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most dangerous acute diseases resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Current methods remain limited with respect to early diagnosis and real&#8208;time feedback on the pathological process. Herein, a targeted activatable fluorescent nanoprobe (V&amp;A@Ag2S) in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) is presented for in&#8197;vivo optical imaging of TBI. Initially, the fluorescence of V&amp;A@Ag2S is turned off owing to energy transfer from Ag2S to the A1094 chromophore. Upon intravenous injection, V&amp;A@Ag2S quickly accumulates in the inflamed vascular endothelium of TBI based on VCAM1&#8208;mediated endocytosis, after which the nanoprobe achieves rapid recovery of the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence of Ag2S quantum dots (QDs) owing to the bleaching of A1094 by the prodromal biomarker of TBI, peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;). The nanoprobe offers high specificity, rapid response, and high sensitivity toward ONOO&#8722;, providing a convenient approach for in&#8197;vivo early real&#8208;time assessment of TBI.

      <title>A Dual&#8208;Ligand Porous Coordination Polymer Chemiresistor with Modulated Conductivity and Porosity</title>
      <dc:description>
Makes sense: As two ligands offer more opportunity than one to tune MOF conductivity and topology, a 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated copper&#8208;based electronically conductive MOF with two different trigonal organic ligands was developed (see structure). The semiconductivity and high porosity of the resulting nanowires provided a low conductivity baseline and highly accessible surface areas, thus resulting in excellent room&#8208;temperature chemiresistive sensing properties.







Abstract
Single&#8208;ligand&#8208;based electronically conductive porous coordination polymers/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (EC&#8208;PCPs/MOFs) fail to meet the requirements of numerous electronic applications owing to their limited tunability in terms of both conductivity and topology. In this study, a new 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated EC&#8208;MOF containing copper units with mixed trigonal ligands was developed: Cu3(HHTP)(THQ) (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydrotriphenylene, THQ=tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;quinone). The modulated conductivity (&#963;&#8776;2.53&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with an activation energy of 0.30&#8197;eV) and high porosity (ca. 441.2&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) of the Cu3(HHTP)(THQ) semiconductive nanowires provided an appropriate resistance baseline and highly accessible areas for the development of an excellent chemiresistive gas sensor.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Makes sense&lt;/b&gt;: As two ligands offer more opportunity than one to tune MOF conductivity and topology, a 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated copper&#8208;based electronically conductive MOF with two different trigonal organic ligands was developed (see structure). The semiconductivity and high porosity of the resulting nanowires provided a low conductivity baseline and highly accessible surface areas, thus resulting in excellent room&#8208;temperature chemiresistive sensing properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single&#8208;ligand&#8208;based electronically conductive porous coordination polymers/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (EC&#8208;PCPs/MOFs) fail to meet the requirements of numerous electronic applications owing to their limited tunability in terms of both conductivity and topology. In this study, a new 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated EC&#8208;MOF containing copper units with mixed trigonal ligands was developed: Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)(THQ) (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydrotriphenylene, THQ=tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;quinone). The modulated conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;2.53&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an activation energy of 0.30&#8197;eV) and high porosity (ca. 441.2&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)(THQ) semiconductive nanowires provided an appropriate resistance baseline and highly accessible areas for the development of an excellent chemiresistive gas sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long&#8208;Range Chirality Recognition of a Polar Molecule on Au(111)</title>
      <dc:description>
Spooky chirality: Long&#8208;range chirality recognition is presented between neighboring 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (BNOL) stripes on an inert Au(111) surface across the herringbone reconstruction as investigated by STM and DFT calculations. The key to achieving such long&#8208;range chirality recognition is the herringbone reconstruction&#8208;induced local dipole accumulation at the edges of the BNOL stripes.







Abstract
Chiral molecular self&#8208;assemblies were usually achieved using short&#8208;range intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen&#8208;, metal&#8211;organic, and covalent bonding. However, unavoidable surface defects, such as step edges, surface reconstructions, or site dislocations may limit the applicability of short&#8208;range chirality recognition. Long&#8208;range chirality recognition on surfaces would be an appealing but challenging strategy for chiral reservation across surface defects at long distances. Now, long&#8208;range chirality recognition is presented between neighboring 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (BNOL) stripes on an inert Au(111) surface across the herringbone reconstruction as investigated by STM and DFT calculations. The key to achieving such recognition is the herringbone reconstruction&#8208;induced local dipole accumulation at the edges of the BNOL stripes. The neighboring stripes are then forced to adopt the same chirality to create the opposite edged dipoles and neutralize the neighbored dipole moments.

      <title>A Gas Chromatography&#8208;Molecular Rotational Resonance Spectroscopy Based System of Singular Specificity</title>
      <dc:description>
Super specific separations: Unparalleled structural specificity for isobaric, isotopic, and isomeric compounds is obtained through the first combination of high&#8208;efficiency separations with high&#8208;resolution rotational resonance spectroscopy. Even closely related species in minute amounts of complex mixtures can be rapidly and unambiguously identified and quantified.







Abstract
We designed and demonstrated the unique abilities of the first gas chromatography&#8211;molecular rotational resonance spectrometer (GC&#8208;MRR). While broadly and routinely applicable, its capabilities can exceed those of high&#8208;resolution MS and NMR spectroscopy in terms of selectivity, resolution, and compound identification. A series of 24 isotopologues and isotopomers of five organic compounds are separated, identified, and quantified in a single run. Natural isotopic abundances of mixtures of compounds containing chlorine, bromine, and sulfur heteroatoms are easily determined. MRR detection provides the added high specificity for these selective gas&#8208;phase separations. GC&#8208;MRR is shown to be ideal for compound&#8208;specific isotope analysis (CSIA). Different bacterial cultures and groundwater were shown to have contrasting isotopic selectivities for common organic compounds. The ease of such GC&#8208;MRR measurements may initiate a new era in biosynthetic/degradation and geochemical isotopic compound studies.

      <title>Modular Assembly of Host&#8211;Guest Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks Using Macrocyclic Building Blocks</title>
      <dc:description>
Networking: The synthesis of host phenolic building blocks, consisting of macrocyclic host rings and phenolic coordinating functions, enables the rapid assembly of adherent conformal metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings on diverse substrates with modular and tunable interfacial properties using host&#8211;guest chemistry.







Abstract
The manipulation of interfacial properties has broad implications for the development of high&#8208;performance coatings. Metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) are an emerging class of responsive, adherent materials. Herein, host&#8211;guest chemistry is integrated with MPNs to modulate their surface chemistry and interfacial properties. Macrocyclic cyclodextrins (host) are conjugated to catechol or galloyl groups and subsequently used as components for the assembly of functional MPNs. The assembled cyclodextrin&#8208;based MPNs are highly permeable (even to high molecular weight polymers: 250&#8211;500&#8197;kDa), yet they specifically and noncovalently interact with various functional guests (including small molecules, polymers, and carbon nanomaterials), allowing for modular and reversible control over interfacial properties. Specifically, by using either hydrophobic or hydrophilic guest molecules, the wettability of the MPNs can be readily tuned between superrepellency (&gt;150&#176;) and superwetting (ca. 0&#176;).

      <title>High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
My brave phase: A high entropy oxide (HEO) cathode, containing nine additional components, the layered O3&#8208;phase NaNi0.12Cu0.12Mg0.12Fe0.15Co0.15Mn0.1Ti0.1Sn0.1Sb0.04O2, delivers long cycling stabilities and high rate capability. As more than 60&#8201;% of the capacity is stored in the O3&#8208;type region, the entropy stabilization of the O3&#8208;phase gives the cycling stability and better rate performance.







Abstract
Material innovation on high&#8208;performance Na&#8208;ion cathodes and the corresponding understanding of structural chemistry still remain a challenge. Herein, we report a new concept of high&#8208;entropy strategy to design layered oxide cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries. An example of layered O3&#8208;type NaNi0.12Cu0.12Mg0.12Fe0.15Co0.15Mn0.1Ti0.1Sn0.1Sb0.04O2 has been demonstrated, which exhibits the longer cycling stability (ca. 83&#8201;% of capacity retention after 500&#8197;cycles) and the outstanding rate capability (ca. 80&#8201;% of capacity retention at the rate of 5.0&#8201;C). A highly reversible phase&#8208;transition behavior between O3 and P3 structures occurs during the charge&#8208;discharge process, and importantly, this behavior is delayed with more than 60&#8201;% of the total capacity being stored in O3&#8208;type region. Possible mechanism can be attributed to the multiple transition&#8208;metal components in this high&#8208;entropy material which can accommodate the changes of local interactions during Na+ (de)intercalation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My brave phase&lt;/b&gt;: A high entropy oxide (HEO) cathode, containing nine additional components, the layered O3&#8208;phase NaNi&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, delivers long cycling stabilities and high rate capability. As more than 60&#8201;% of the capacity is stored in the O3&#8208;type region, the entropy stabilization of the O3&#8208;phase gives the cycling stability and better rate performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material innovation on high&#8208;performance Na&#8208;ion cathodes and the corresponding understanding of structural chemistry still remain a challenge. Herein, we report a new concept of high&#8208;entropy strategy to design layered oxide cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries. An example of layered O3&#8208;type NaNi&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been demonstrated, which exhibits the longer cycling stability (ca. 83&#8201;% of capacity retention after 500&#8197;cycles) and the outstanding rate capability (ca. 80&#8201;% of capacity retention at the rate of 5.0&#8201;C). A highly reversible phase&#8208;transition behavior between O3 and P3 structures occurs during the charge&#8208;discharge process, and importantly, this behavior is delayed with more than 60&#8201;% of the total capacity being stored in O3&#8208;type region. Possible mechanism can be attributed to the multiple transition&#8208;metal components in this high&#8208;entropy material which can accommodate the changes of local interactions during Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (de)intercalation. This strategy opens new insights into the development of advanced cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced ortho&#8208;Selective Migration on Pyridyl Ring: Trifluoromethylative Pyridylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Remote migration: The photocatalyzed ortho&#8208;selective migration on a pyridyl ring has been achieved for the site&#8208;selective trifluoromethylative pyridylation of unactivated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. Notably, this method could be successfully extended to tertiary radicals to forge quaternary C&#8197;centers bearing C2&#8208;substituted pyridyl groups, overriding the commonly observed preference for the C4&#8197;addition.







Abstract
The photocatalyzed ortho&#8208;selective migration on a pyridyl ring has been achieved for the site&#8208;selective trifluoromethylative pyridylation of unactivated alkenes. The overall process is initiated by the selective addition of a CF3 radical to the alkene to provide a nucleophilic alkyl radical intermediate, which enables an intramolecular endo addition exclusively to the ortho&#8208;position of the pyridinium salt. Both secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals are well&#8208;suited for addition to the C2&#8208;position of pyridinium salts to ultimately provide synthetically valuable C2&#8208;fluoroalkyl functionalized pyridines. Moreover, the method was successfully applied to the reaction with P&#8208;centered radicals. The utility of this transformation was further demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules.

      <title>Palladium Single Atoms on TiO2 as a Photocatalytic Sensing Platform for Analyzing the Organophosphorus Pesticide Chlorpyrifos</title>
      <dc:description>
DetectHER: A palladium single&#8208;atom (PdSA)/TiO2 platform directly detects the organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos with high sensitivity and selectivity. PdSA/TiO2, prepared by an in&#8197;situ photocatalytic reduction of PdCl42&#8722; on TiO2, shows high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In the presence of chlorpyrifos, the photocatalytic activity of PdSA/TiO2 decreases.







Abstract
Traditional methods for analyzing organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos, usually require the tedious sample pretreatment and sophisticated bio&#8208;interfaces, leading to the difficulty for real&#8208;time analysis. Herein, we use palladium single&#8208;atom (PdSA)/TiO2 as a photocatalytic sensing platform to directly detect chlorpyrifos with high sensitivity and selectivity. PdSA/TiO2, prepared by an in&#8197;situ photocatalytic reduction of PdCl42&#8722; on the TiO2, shows much higher photocatalytic activity (10&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) for hydrogen evolution reaction than Pd nanoparticles (1.95&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), and excellent stability. In the presence of chlorpyrifos, the photocatalytic activity of PdSA/TiO2 decreases. Through this inhibition effect the platform can realize a detection limit for chlorpyrifos of 0.01&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1, much lower than the maximum residue limit (10&#8197;ppb) permitted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Abstract
A wide range of alkyl&#8208;, aryl&#8208; and heteroarylzinc halides were aminated with highly functionalized alkyl, aryl, and heterocyclic azides. The reaction proceeds smoothly at 50&#8201;&#176;C within 1&#8197;h in the presence of FeCl3 (0.5&#8197;equiv) to furnish the corresponding secondary amines in good yields. This method was extended to peptidic azides and provided the arylated substrates with full retention of configuration. To demonstrate the utility of this reaction, we prepared two amine derivatives of pharmaceutical relevance using this iron&#8208;mediated electrophilic amination as the key step.

Abstract
SF6 was applied as pentafluorosulfanylation reagent to prepare ethers with a vicinal SF5 substituent through a one&#8208;step method involving photoredox catalysis. This method shows a broad substrate scope with respect to applicable alcohols for the conversion of &#945;&#8208;methyl and &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes. The products bear a new structural motif with two functional groups installed in one step. The alkoxy group allows elimination and azidation as further transformations into valuable pentafluorosulfanylated compounds. These results confirm that non&#8208;toxic SF6 is a useful SF5 transfer reagent if properly activated by photoredox catalysis, and toxic reagents are completely avoided. In combination with light as an energy source, a high level of sustainability is achieved. Through this method, the proposed potential of the SF5 substituent in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials chemistry may be exploited in the future.

      <title>A Chiral Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Monkey Saddle</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on a truxene a chiral monkey saddle shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three eight&#8208;membered rings was accessible in only three synthetic steps. The enantiomers were separated by chiral HPLC and investigated photophysically.







Abstract
A contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in the shape of a monkey saddle has been synthesized in three steps from a readily available truxene precursor. The monkey saddle PAH is consisting of three five&#8208;, seven six&#8208;, and three eight&#8208;membered rings and has been unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Owing to the three biaryl axes the monkey saddle PAH is inherently chiral. The inversion of the two enantiomeric structures into each other preferably occurs through a twisting of peripheral rings rather than by a fully planar intermediate, as has been calculated by DFT methods. Enantiomers were separated by chiral HPLC and inversion barriers determined by variable temperature circular dichroism spectroscopy, supporting the twisting mechanism.

      <title>The Quasi&#8208;Binary Acetonitriletriide Sr3[C2N]2</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystals of the first quasi&#8208;binary acetonitriletriide Sr3[C2N]2 were obtained from the solid&#8208;state reaction of Sr metal, graphite, and Sr(N3)2. The identity of the nearly colourless crystals was proven via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy.

Abstract
The first quasi&#8208;binary acetonitriletriide Sr3[C2N]2 has been synthesised and characterised. The nearly colourless crystals were obtained from the reaction of Sr metal, graphite, and elemental N2, generated by decomposition of Sr(N3)2, in a sealed Ni ampoule with the aid of an alkali metal flux. The structure of this compound was analysed via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the identity of the [C2N]3&#8722; anion was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and further investigated by quantum&#8208;chemical methods. Computed interatomic distances within the [C2N]3&#8722; anion strikingly match the obtained experimental data.

      <title>Characterization of Radical SAM Adenosylhopane Synthase, HpnH, which Catalyzes the 5&#8242;&#8208;Deoxyadenosyl Radical Addition to Diploptene in the Biosynthesis of C35 Bacteriohopanepolyols</title>
      <dc:description>
HpnH catalyzes C&#8722;C formation between diploptene and a SAM&#8208;derived 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine during the biosynthesis of bacteriohopanepolyol, which is a prokaryotic cell&#8208;membrane lipid. The stereochemistry at C22 of the adenosylhopane produced by HpnH from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is (R)&#8208;configuration, and a hydrogen atom is derived from water to complete the radical addition reaction.







Abstract
Adenosylhopane is a crucial intermediate in the biosynthesis of bacteriohopanepolyols, which are widespread prokaryotic membrane lipids. Herein, it is demonstrated that reconstituted HpnH, a putative radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme, commonly encoded in the hopanoid biosynthetic gene cluster, converts diploptene into adenosylhopane in the presence of SAM, flavodoxin, flavodoxin reductase, and NADPH. NMR spectra of the enzymatic reaction product were identical to those of synthetic (22R)&#8208;adenosylhopane, indicating that HpnH catalyzes stereoselective C&#8722;C formation between C29 of diploptene and C5&#8242; of 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine. Further, the HpnH reaction in D2O&#8208;containing buffer revealed that a D atom was incorporated at the C22 position of adenosylhopane. Based on these results, we propose a radical addition reaction mechanism catalyzed by HpnH for the formation of the C35 bacteriohopane skeleton.

      <title>Cellulose Nanocrystal Elastomers with Reversible Visible Color</title>
      <dc:description>
Mechanical stress sensors were prepared from cellulose nanocrystal&#8208;elastomer composites, which provide a reversible visible color readout.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals have potential applications in mechanical sensors and soft displays; however, new materials are constantly desired to provide new innovations and improve on existing technologies. To address this, we report stretchable chiral nematic cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) elastomer composites that exhibit reversible visible color upon the application of mechanical stress. When stretched (or compressed) the colorless materials maintain their chiral nematic structure but the helical pitch is reduced into the visible region, resulting in coloration of the CNC&#8208;elastomer composite. By increasing the percentage elongation of the material (ca. 50&#8211;300&#8201;%), the structural color can be tuned from red to blue. The color of the materials was characterized by reflectance optical microscopy and reflectance circular dichroism to confirm the wavelength and polarization of the reflected light. We also probed the mechanism of the structural color using 2D&#8208;X&#8208;ray diffraction. Finally, by either water&#8208;patterning the starting CNC film, or by forming a CNC film with gradient color, through masked evaporation, we were able to prepare encoded stretchable chiral nematic CNC&#8208;elastomers.

      <dc:description>
Electronic building blocks: 1,3&#8208;Indandione&#8208;terminated quinoids with various termini and central cores were synthesized by an alkoxide&#8208;mediated rearrangement reaction. Their properties can be regulated by tuning the central cores and the aryl termini.

Abstract
A series of 1,3&#8208;indandione&#8208;terminated &#960;&#8208;conjugated quinoids were synthesized by alkoxide&#8208;mediated rearrangement reaction of the respective alkene precursors, followed by air oxidation. This new protocol allows access to quinoidal compounds with variable termini and cores. The resulting quinoids all show LUMO levels below &#8722;4.0&#8197;eV and molar extinction coefficients above 105&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. The optoelectronic properties of these compounds can be regulated by tuning the central cores as well as the aryl termini ascribed to the delocalized frontier molecular orbitals over the entire molecular skeleton involving aryl termini. n&#8208;Channel organic thin&#8208;film transistors with electron mobility of up to 0.38&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 were fabricated, showing the potential of this new class of quinoids as organic semiconductors.

      <title>Efficient and Divergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Halogenated Amides and Esters by Double Electrophilic Activation of Ynamides</title>
      <dc:description>
Upon simple reaction with in situ generated HCl and an electrophilic halogenation reagent (NXS) in the presence of water or an alcohol, a broad range of ynamides can be transformed, in a highly divergent manner, into &#945;&#8208;iodo, &#945;&#8208;bromo, and &#945;&#8208;chloro amides and esters with high efficiency and under mild conditions. Highly reactive keteniminium and iminium ions are generated sequentially in this double electrophilic activation of ynamides.







Abstract
An efficient and modular entry to &#945;&#8208;halogenated amides and esters is reported. This reaction is based on an underestimated double electrophilic activation of ynamides sequentially involving highly reactive activated keteniminium and iminium ions. Upon simple reaction with HCl and an electrophilic halogenation reagent in the presence of water or an alcohol, a broad range of ynamides can be transformed, in a highly divergent manner, to &#945;&#8208;halo amides and esters with high efficiency and under mild conditions.

      <title>Highly Selective Production of Ethylene by the Electroreduction of Carbon Monoxide</title>
      <dc:description>
CORTE in the act: A direct electrocatalytic process allows a highly selective CO reduction to ethylene (CORTE) with water over Cu catalysts at room temperature and ambient pressure. An unprecedented 52.7&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene formation results from optimization of the cathode structure to facilitate CO diffusion.







Abstract
Conversion of carbon monoxide to high value&#8208;added ethylene with high selectivity by traditional syngas conversion process is challenging because of the limitation of Anderson&#8208;Schulz&#8211;Flory distribution. Herein we report a direct electrocatalytic process for highly selective ethylene production from CO reduction with water over Cu catalysts at room temperature and ambient pressure. An unprecedented 52.7&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene formation is achieved through optimization of cathode structure to facilitate CO diffusion at the surface of the electrode and Cu catalysts to enhance the C&#8722;C bond coupling. The highly selective ethylene production is almost without other carbon&#8208;based byproducts (e.g. C1&#8211;C4 hydrocarbons and CO2) and avoids the drawbacks of the traditional Fischer&#8211;Tropsch process that always delivers undesired products. This study provides a new and promising strategy for highly selective production of ethylene from the abundant industrial CO.

      <title>Improved Stability and Tunable Functionalization of Parallel &#946;&#8208;Sheets via Multicomponent N&#8208;Alkylation of the Turn Moiety</title>
      <dc:description>
Keep it folded: An Ugi&#8208;derived N&#8208;alkylation suitably positioned at the turn moiety of a non&#8208;cyclic parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide enhances the folding propensity and thermal stability in aqueous solution. It also enables the installation of various functionalities, for example an extra cationic group to abolish aggregation, or a thiol for conjugation to a fluorescent label.







Abstract
In contrast to the myriad of methods available to produce &#945;&#8208;helices and antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets in synthetic peptides, just a few are known for the construction of stable, non&#8208;cyclic parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets. Herein, we report an efficient on&#8208;resin approach for the assembly of parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides in which the N&#8208;alkylated turn moiety enhances the stability and gives access to a variety of functionalizations without modifying the parallel strands. The key synthetic step of this strategy is the multicomponent construction of an N&#8208;alkylated turn using the Ugi reaction on varied isocyano&#8208;resins. This four&#8208;component process assembles the orthogonally protected turn fragment and incorporates handles serving for labeling/conjugation purposes or for reducing peptide aggregation. NMR and circular dichroism analyses confirm the better&#8208;structured and more stable parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets in the N&#8208;alkylated peptides compared to the non&#8208;functionalized variants.

      <title>Unpaired 3d Electrons on Atomically Dispersed Cobalt Centres in Coordination Polymers Regulate both Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) Activity and Selectivity for Use in Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The battery HITParade: Bimetallic coordination polymers with varying Ni/Co ratios and the HITP ligand (HITP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene) have different activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Abstract
Reversible oxygen conversion is important for various green energy technologies. Herein we synthesize a series of bimetallic coordination polymers by varying the Ni/Co ratio and using HITP (HITP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene) as the ligand, to interrogate the role of metal centres in modulating the activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Co3HITP2 and Ni3HITP2 are compared. Unpaired 3d electrons in Co3HITP2 result in less coplanarity but more radical character. Thus, despite of a reduced crystallinity and conductivity, the best ORR activity, comparable to 20&#8201;% Pt/C, is obtained for Co3HITP2, showing the 3d orbital configuration of the metal centre promotes ORR. Experimental and DFT studies show a transition of ORR pathway from four&#8208;electron for Co3HITP2 to two&#8208;electron for Ni3HITP2. Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries using Co3HITP2 as the air cathode catalyst demonstrate excellent energy efficiency and stability.

      <title>Reversible Thermochromism and Strong Ferromagnetism in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
Color, conduction, magnetism: Two new 2D hybrid perovskites exhibit both thermochromism and ferromagnetism. The (BED)2CuCl6 crystal shows a high thermochromic working temperature up to 443&#8197;K, with a dramatic temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity change that spans six orders of magnitude.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites have shown many attractive properties associated with their soft lattices and multiple quantum well structure. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new multifunctional 2D hybrid perovskites, (PED)CuCl4 and (BED)2CuCl6, which show reversible thermochromic behavior, dramatic temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity change, and strong ferromagnetism. Upon temperature change, the (PED)CuCl4 and (BED)2CuCl6 crystals exhibit a reversible color change between yellow and red&#8208;brown. The associated structural changes were monitored by in&#8197;situ temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD). The (BED)2CuCl6 exhibits superior thermal stability, with a thermochromic working temperature up to 443&#8197;K. The conductivity of (BED)2CuCl6 changes over six orders of magnitude upon temperature change. The 2D perovskites exhibit ferromagnetic properties with Curie temperatures around 13&#8197;K.

      <title>Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Antiperovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
Hybrid antiperovskites are expected to have the same potential in producing novel properties as hybrid perovskites. However, the known hybrid antiperovskites are very few. Now the design, synthesis, and characterization of seven ABX3&#8208;type hybrid antiperovskites is presented.







Abstract
Substitution of A&#8208;site and/or X&#8208;site ions of ABX3&#8208;type perovskites with organic groups can give rise to hybrid perovskites, many of which display intriguing properties beyond their parent compounds. However, this method cannot be extended effectively to hybrid antiperovskites. Now, the design of hybrid antiperovskites under the guidance of the concept of Goldschmidt's tolerance factor is presented. Spherical anions were chosen for the A and B sites and spherical organic cations for the X site, and seven hybrid antiperovskites were obtained, including (F3(H2O)x)(AlF6)(H2dabco)3, ((Co(CN)6)(H2O)5)(MF6)(H2dabco)3 (M=Al3+, Cr3+, or In3+), (Co(CN)6)(MF6)(H2pip)3 (M=Al3+ or Cr3+), and (SbI6)(AlF6)(H2dabco)3. These new structures reveal that all ions at A, B, and X sites of inorganic antiperovskites can be replaced by molecular ions to form hybrid antiperovskites. This work will lead to the synthesis of a large family of hybrid antiperovskites.

      <title>On&#8208;Demand Electrochemical Epoxidation in Nano&#8208;Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry to Locate Carbon&#8211;Carbon Double Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Scoring position: The onset of electro&#8208;epoxidation of lipid double bonds can be controlled by simply tuning the spray voltage. The electro&#8208;epoxidized products are then fragmented by tandem mass spectrometry to generate diagnostic ions, indicating the double&#8208;bond position(s).

Abstract
Reported here is the first on&#8208;demand electrochemical epoxidation incorporated into the standard nano&#8208;electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI&#8208;MS) workflow for double&#8208;bond identification. The capability lies in a novel tunable electro&#8208;epoxidation of double bonds, where onset of the reaction can be controlled by simply tuning the spray voltage. On&#8208;demand formation of mono&#8208;/multiple epoxides is achieved at different voltages. The electro&#8208;epoxidized products are then fragmented by tandem MS to generate diagnostic ions, indicating the double bond position(s). The process is completed within seconds, holding great potential for high&#8208;throughput analysis. The rapid switch&#8208;on/off electro&#8208;epoxidation of a single sample, the low sample consumption, the demonstrated applicability to complex lipids containing multiple double bonds, and the advantage of not requiring extra apparatus make this method attractive for use in lipid&#8208;related biological studies.

      <title>Hydrazide&#8208;Catalyzed Polyene Cyclization: Asymmetric Organocatalytic Synthesis of cis&#8208;Decalins</title>
      <dc:description>
Remote stabilization: Chiral bicyclic hydrazides catalyze cyclizations of (Z)&#8208;polyenes to cis&#8208;decalins by means of iminium&#8208;ion catalysis. High enantioselectivity results from remote stabilization of the developing cationic charge in the transition state by the hydrazide carbonyl.







Abstract
Polyene cyclizations offer rapid entry into terpenoid ring systems. Although enantioselective cyclizations of (E)&#8208;polyenes to form trans&#8208;decalin ring systems are well precedented, highly enantioselective cyclizations of (Z)&#8208;polyenes to form the corresponding cis&#8208;decalins have not been reported. Here, we describe the first application of iminium catalysis to the initiation of polyene cyclizations. Ethyl 1,2&#8208;diazepane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate catalyzes the cyclization of polyenes bearing enal initiators. Moreover, chiral bicyclic hydrazides catalyze the cyclizations of (Z)&#8208;polyene substrates to form cis&#8208;decalins with enantioselectivities of up to 97:3 er. DFT calculations suggest the catalysts promote the reaction by stabilizing positive charge as it develops during the bicyclization.

      <dc:description>
A dibora[2]ferrocenophane undergoes 100&#8201;% trans&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;dihydroboration with amino&#8208; and aryldihydroboranes, with formal insertion of a borylene unit into the B=B double bond.

Abstract
The reaction of aryl&#8208; and amino(dihydro)boranes with dibora[2]ferrocenophane 1 leads to the formation 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrotriboranes by formal hydrogenation and insertion of a borylene unit into the B=B bond. The aryltriborane derivatives undergo reversible photoisomerization to the cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;H&#8208;3&#8208;hydrotriboranes, while hydride abstraction affords cationic triboranes, which represent the first doubly base&#8208;stabilized B3H4+ analogues.

      <title>f&#8208;Element Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes: A Tetrasilylcyclobutadienyl&#8211;Uranium(IV)&#8211;Tris(tetrahydroborate) Anion Pianostool Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Pianostool: The first example of an f&#8208;element half&#8208;sandwich cyclobutadienyl complex, which is only the second example of an actinide&#8211;cyclobutadienyl complex, is reported. Calculations suggest that U&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bonding dominates, with no &#948;&#8208;bonding component.







Abstract
Despite there being numerous examples of f&#8208;element compounds supported by cyclopentadienyl, arene, cycloheptatrienyl, and cyclooctatetraenyl ligands (C5&#8211;8), cyclobutadienyl (C4) complexes remain exceedingly rare. Here, we report that reaction of [Li2{C4(SiMe3)4}(THF)2] (1) with [U(BH4)3(THF)2] (2) gives the pianostool complex [U{C4(SiMe3)4}(BH4)3][Li(THF)4] (3), where use of a borohydride and preformed C4&#8208;unit circumvents difficulties in product isolation and closing a C4&#8208;ring at uranium. Complex 3 is an unprecedented example of an f&#8208;element half&#8208;sandwich cyclobutadienyl complex, and it is only the second example of an actinide&#8208;cyclobutadienyl complex, the other being an inverse&#8208;sandwich. The U&#8722;C distances are short (av. 2.513&#8197;&#197;), reflecting the formal 2&#8722; charge of the C4&#8208;unit, and the SiMe3 groups are displaced from the C4&#8208;plane, which we propose maximises U&#8722;C4 orbital overlap. DFT calculations identify two quasi&#8208;degenerate U&#8722;C4 &#960;&#8208;bonds utilising the &#968;2 and &#968;3 molecular orbitals of the C4&#8208;unit, but the potential &#948;&#8208;bond using the &#968;4 orbital is vacant.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition f&#8208;Element Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes: A Tetrasilylcyclobutadienyl&#8211;Uranium(IV)&#8211;Tris(tetrahydroborate) Anion Pianostool Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pianostool&lt;/b&gt;: The first example of an f&#8208;element half&#8208;sandwich cyclobutadienyl complex, which is only the second example of an actinide&#8211;cyclobutadienyl complex, is reported. Calculations suggest that U&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bonding dominates, with no &#948;&#8208;bonding component.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite there being numerous examples of f&#8208;element compounds supported by cyclopentadienyl, arene, cycloheptatrienyl, and cyclooctatetraenyl ligands (C&lt;sub&gt;5&#8211;8&lt;/sub&gt;), cyclobutadienyl (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) complexes remain exceedingly rare. Here, we report that reaction of [Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with [U(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) gives the pianostool complex [U{C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][Li(THF)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), where use of a borohydride and preformed C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;unit circumvents difficulties in product isolation and closing a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;ring at uranium. Complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is an unprecedented example of an f&#8208;element half&#8208;sandwich cyclobutadienyl complex, and it is only the second example of an actinide&#8208;cyclobutadienyl complex, the other being an inverse&#8208;sandwich. The U&#8722;C distances are short (av. 2.513&#8197;&#197;), reflecting the formal 2&#8722; charge of the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;unit, and the SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups are displaced from the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;plane, which we propose maximises U&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; orbital overlap. DFT calculations identify two quasi&#8208;degenerate U&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &#960;&#8208;bonds utilising the &#968;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &#968;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecular orbitals of the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;unit, but the potential &#948;&#8208;bond using the &#968;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is vacant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Site&#8208;Selective Alkoxylation of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds by Photoredox Catalysis
</title>
      <dc:description>
Partner up: Photocatalysis offers a one&#8208;step strategy to selectively functionalize the benzylic positions of electron&#8208;rich arenes with alcohols. It merges the photoredox activation of arenes with copper(II)&#8208;mediated oxidation of the resulting benzylic radicals, enabling the introduction of benzylic C&#8722;O bonds with high site selectivity, chemoselectivity, and functional&#8208;group tolerance using only two equiv of the alcohol coupling partner.







Abstract
Methods that enable the direct C&#8722;H alkoxylation of complex organic molecules are significantly underdeveloped, particularly in comparison to analogous strategies for C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formation. In particular, almost all methods for the incorporation of alcohols by C&#8722;H oxidation require the use of the alcohol component as a solvent or co&#8208;solvent. This condition limits the practical scope of these reactions to simple, inexpensive alcohols. Reported here is a photocatalytic protocol for the functionalization of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with a wide range of oxygen nucleophiles. This strategy merges the photoredox activation of arenes with copper(II)&#8208;mediated oxidation of the resulting benzylic radicals, which enables the introduction of benzylic C&#8722;O bonds with high site selectivity, chemoselectivity, and functional&#8208;group tolerance using only two equivalents of the alcohol coupling partner. This method enables the late&#8208;stage introduction of complex alkoxy groups into bioactive molecules, providing a practical new tool with potential applications in synthesis and medicinal chemistry.

      <title>Dehydrogenative Anodic C&#8722;C Coupling of Phenols Bearing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups</title>
      <dc:description>
Driven by electricity, the dehydrogenative coupling reaction of phenols carrying electron&#8208;withdrawing groups to give 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenols or the corresponding polycyclic derivatives is facilitated for the first time. 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoroisopropanol and a small amount of base in the electrolyte make additional supporting electrolyte superfluous. The electrolysis is scalable, can be conducted with very simple equipment, and is much more concise than previous conventional syntheses.







Abstract
We herein present a metal&#8208;free, electrosynthetic method that enables the direct dehydrogenative coupling reactions of phenols carrying electron&#8208;withdrawing groups for the first time. The reactions are easy to conduct and scalable, as they are carried out in undivided cells and obviate the necessity for additional supporting electrolyte. As such, this conversion is efficient, practical, and thereby environmentally friendly, as production of waste is minimized. The method features a broad substrate scope, and a variety of functional groups are tolerated, providing easy access to precursors for novel polydentate ligands and even heterocycles such as dibenzofurans.

      <title>Inverting External Asymmetric Induction via Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis: A Strategy to &#946;&#8208;Chiral Phosphonate Antipodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A stereodivergent hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphonates is disclosed using a single enantiomer of the catalyst. This enables generation of the R&#8208; or S&#8208;configured &#946;&#8208;chiral phosphonate with equal and opposite selectivity. Enantiodivergence is regulated at the substrate level through the development of a facile E &#8594; Z isomerisation. This has been enabled for the first time by selective energy transfer catalysis using anthracene as an inexpensive organic photosensitiser.







Abstract
Enantiodivergent, catalytic reduction of activated alkenes relays stereochemical information encoded in the antipodal chiral catalysts to the pro&#8208;chiral substrate. Although powerful, the strategy remains vulnerable to costs and availability of sourcing both catalyst enantiomers. Herein, a stereodivergent hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated phosphonates is disclosed using a single enantiomer of the catalyst. This enables generation of the R&#8208; or S&#8208;configured &#946;&#8208;chiral phosphonate with equal and opposite selectivity. Enantiodivergence is regulated at the substrate level through the development of a facile E &#8594; Z isomerisation. This has been enabled for the first time by selective energy transfer catalysis using anthracene as an inexpensive organic photosensitiser. Synthetically valuable in its own right, this process enables subsequent RhI&#8208;mediated stereospecific hydrogenation to generate both enantiomers of the product using only the S&#8208;catalyst (up to 99:1 and 3:97 e.r.). This strategy out&#8208;competes the selectivities observed with the E&#8208;substrate and the R&#8208;catalyst.

      <title>Regioselective Hydrosilylation of Olefins Catalyzed by a Molecular Calcium Hydride Cation</title>
      <dc:description>
The CaH effect: The calcium hydride cation [CaH]+ catalyzes the regioselective hydrosilylation of ethylene, &#945;&#8208;olefins, and styrene derivatives. Aliphatic hydrosilanes are preferred over commonly employed silanes such as PhSiH3 as the latter undergoes scrambling reactions.







Abstract
Chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity are often difficult to control during olefin hydrosilylation catalyzed by d&#8208; and f&#8208;block metal complexes. The cationic hydride of calcium [CaH]+ stabilized by an NNNN macrocycle was found to catalyze the regioselective hydrosilylation of aliphatic olefins to give anti&#8208;Markovnikov products, while aryl&#8208;substituted olefins were hydrosilyated with Markovnikov regioselectivity. Ethylene was efficiently hydrosilylated by primary and secondary hydrosilanes to give di&#8208; and monoethylated silanes. Aliphatic hydrosilanes were preferred over other commonly employed hydrosilanes: Arylsilanes such as PhSiH3 underwent scrambling reactions promoted by the nucleophilic hydride, while alkoxy&#8208; and siloxy&#8208;substituted hydrosilanes gave isolable alkoxy and siloxy calcium derivatives.

      <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed &#946;&#8208;Methylation of Alcohols Using Methanol as C1 Source</title>
      <dc:description>
Why not manganese? A molecular catalyst based on manganese as the central metal allows the use of methanol as a benign reagent to install methyl groups in &#946;&#8208;position to alcohol functionalities, opening novel synthetic pathways to methyl&#8208;branched products in line with green chemistry principles.







Abstract
Highly selective &#946;&#8208;methylation of alcohols was achieved using an earth&#8208;abundant first row transition metal in the air stable molecular manganese complex [Mn(CO)2Br[HN(C2H4PiPr2)2]] 1 ([HN(C2H4PiPr2)2]=MACHO&#8208;iPr). The reaction requires only low loadings of 1 (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), methanolate as base and MeOH as methylation reagent as well as solvent. Various alcohols were &#946;&#8208;methylated with very good selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) and excellent yield (up to 94&#8201;%). Biomass derived aliphatic alcohols and diols were also selectively methylated on the &#946;&#8208;position, opening a pathway to &#8220;biohybrid&#8221; molecules constructed entirely from non&#8208;fossil carbon. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through a borrowing hydrogen pathway involving metal&#8211;ligand cooperation at the Mn&#8208;pincer complex. This transformation provides a convenient, economical, and environmentally benign pathway for the selective C&#8722;C bond formation with potential applications for the preparation of advanced biofuels, fine chemicals, and biologically active molecules

      <title>Tandem Use of Optical Sensing and Machine Learning for the Determination of Absolute Configuration, Enantiomeric and Diastereomeric Ratios, and Concentration of Chiral Samples</title>
      <dc:description>
Stereo sensing: The combination of optical sensing and machine learning streamlines the analysis of small amounts of complex stereochemical mixtures of chiral compounds based on a simple mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure workflow that uses inexpensive chemicals while cumbersome protection chemistry and any type of sample work&#8208;up are avoided.







Abstract
We have developed an optical method for accurate concentration, er, and dr analysis of amino alcohols based on a simple mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure workflow that is fully adaptable to multiwell plate technology and microscale analysis. The conversion of the four aminoindanol stereoisomers with salicylaldehyde to the corresponding Schiff base allows analysis of the dr based on a change in the UV maximum at 420&#8197;nm that is very different for the homo&#8208; and heterochiral diastereomers and of the concentration of the sample using a hypsochromic shift of another absorption band around 340&#8197;nm that is independent of the analyte stereochemistry. Subsequent in&#8197;situ formation of CuII assemblies in the absence and presence of base enables quantification of the er values for each diastereomeric pair by CD analysis. Applying a linear programming method and a parameter sweep algorithm, we determined the concentration and relative amounts of each of the four stereoisomers in 20 samples of vastly different stereoisomeric compositions with an averaged absolute percent error of 1.7&#8201;%.

      <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Insertion Reaction of Quinoid Carbene: A Radical Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
On the rebound: Direct intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation is achieved by an IrIII/porphyrin&#8208;catalyzed formal quinoid carbene (QC) insertion reaction through a stepwise radical mechanism. This reaction is enabled by the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) reactivity of the metal&#8208;QC intermediate, and the subsequent radical rebound step is facilitated by an electrophilic IrIII center that preserves the radical character of the QC ligand.







Abstract
Described herein is an IrIII/porphyrin&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion reaction of a quinoid carbene (QC). The reaction was designed by harnessing the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) reactivity of a metal&#8208;QC species with aliphatic substrates followed by a radical rebound process to afford C&#8722;H arylation products. This methodology is efficient for the arylation of activated hydrocarbons such as 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes (down to 40&#8197;min reaction time, up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 1.0&#8197;g scale). It features unique regioselectivity, which is mainly governed by steric effects, as the insertion into primary C&#8722;H bonds is favored over secondary and/or tertiary C&#8722;H bonds in the substituted cyclohexene substrates. Mechanistic studies revealed a radical mechanism for the reaction.

      <title>Responsive Exosome Nano&#8208;bioconjugates for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Ok, take a bite: Responsive exosome nano&#8208;bioconjugates were constructed by engineering M1 exosomes with aCD47 and aSIRP&#945; linked with a pH&#8208;sensitive bond. After systemic administration, the synergism of specific targeting by aCD47, blocking of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signaling by aCD47 and aSIRP&#945;, and M2 reprogramming by M1 exosomes resulted in a potent anticancer effect.







Abstract
Exosomes hold great potential in therapeutic development. However, native exosomes usually induce insufficient effects in&#8197;vivo and simply act as drug delivery vehicles. Herein, we synthesize responsive exosome nano&#8208;bioconjugates for cancer therapy. Azide&#8208;modified exosomes derived from M1 macrophages are conjugated with dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;modified antibodies of CD47 and SIRP&#945; (aCD47 and aSIRP&#945;) through pH&#8208;sensitive linkers. After systemic administration, the nano&#8208;bioconjugates can actively target tumors through the specific recognition between aCD47 and CD47 on the tumor cell surface. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, the benzoic&#8208;imine bonds of the nano&#8208;bioconjugates are cleaved to release aSIRP&#945; and aCD47 that can, respectively, block SIRP&#945; on macrophages and CD47, leading to abolished &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signaling and improved phagocytosis of macrophages. Meanwhile, the native M1 exosomes effectively reprogram the macrophages from pro&#8208;tumoral M2 to anti&#8208;tumoral M1.

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cacchi Reaction: Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Indoles</title>
      <dc:description>
Axially chiral indoles: In the presence of a chiral QuinoxP*PdII complex, two simple achiral building blocks undergo cyclizative cross&#8208;coupling to afford 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles bearing a C2&#8208;aryl chiral axis in high yields and enantioselectivity. The indole ring is constructed de&#8197;novo in this process and a complexation&#8208;induced chirality transfer is proposed to account for the observed enantioselectivity.







Abstract
We report herein the first examples of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Cacchi reaction for the synthesis of indoles bearing a chiral C2&#8208;aryl axis. In the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2 and (R,R)&#8208;QuinoxP* ligand, reaction of N&#8208;aryl(alkyl)sulfonyl&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylanilides with arylboronic acids under oxygen atmosphere afforded enantioenriched 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles in high yields and enantioselectivity. The indole ring is constructed de&#8197;novo in this process and a complexation&#8208;induced chirality transfer is proposed to account for the observed enantioselectivity.

     alt="Angewandte Chemie International Edition Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cacchi Reaction: Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral 2,3&#8208;Disubstituted Indoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Axially chiral indoles&lt;/b&gt;: In the presence of a chiral QuinoxP*Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex, two simple achiral building blocks undergo cyclizative cross&#8208;coupling to afford 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles bearing a C2&#8208;aryl chiral axis in high yields and enantioselectivity. The indole ring is constructed de&#8197;novo in this process and a complexation&#8208;induced chirality transfer is proposed to account for the observed enantioselectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein the first examples of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Cacchi reaction for the synthesis of indoles bearing a chiral C2&#8208;aryl axis. In the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;QuinoxP* ligand, reaction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl(alkyl)sulfonyl&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylanilides with arylboronic acids under oxygen atmosphere afforded enantioenriched 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles in high yields and enantioselectivity. The indole ring is constructed de&#8197;novo in this process and a complexation&#8208;induced chirality transfer is proposed to account for the observed enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Based Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Despite the rapid developments in the past decade, many great challenges remain for the practical use of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based electrocatalysts. This Minireview summaries some major recent research efforts and advances on MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Some promising directions and strategies are also discussed.







Abstract
In view of the clean and sustainable energy, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based materials, including pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and their derivatives are emerging as unique electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thanks to their tunable compositions and diverse structures, efficient MOF&#8208;based materials provide new opportunities to accelerate the sluggish ORR at the cathode in fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. This Minireview first provides some introduction of ORR and MOFs, followed by the classification of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts towards ORR. Recent breakthroughs in engineering MOF&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts are highlighted with an emphasis on synthesis strategy, component, morphology, structure, electrocatalytic performance, and reaction mechanism. Finally, some current challenges and future perspectives for MOF&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts are also discussed.

      <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Honeycomb CuP2@C in ZnCl2 Molten Salt for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature method is used to synthesize honeycomb&#8208;like phosphorus&#8208;rich CuP2@C nanostructure for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries through PCl3 reduction and in&#8197;situ phosphorization of MOF derived Cu@C. Simultaneous reduction of PCl3 and SnCl4 on a mechanically activated Na surface and in&#8197;situ combination into phosphide has a high phosphorizing efficiency and good control of Sn4P3 nucleation size.







Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;rich metal phosphides have very high lithium storage capacities, but they are difficult to prepare. A low&#8208;temperature phosphorization method based on Mg reducing PCl3 in ZnCl2 molten salt at 300&#8201;&#176;C is developed to synthesize phosphorus&#8208;rich CuP2@C from a Cu&#8208;MOF derived Cu@C composite. Abnormal oxidation of Cu by Zn2+ in the molten salt is observed, which leads to the porous honeycomb nanostructure and homogeneously distributed ultrafine CuP2 nanocrystals. The honeycomb CuP2@C exhibits excellent lithium storage performance with high reversible capacity (1146&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling stability (720&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), showing the promising application of P&#8208;rich metal phosphides in lithium ion batteries.

      <title>Catalytic Stereoselective Borylative Transannular Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation can be used to trigger highly diastereoselective and enantioselective transannular reactions that enable the construction of complex bicyclic scaffolds.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;sized carbocycles containing an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone moiety as Michael acceptor site and a ketone moiety as internal electrophilic site are ideal substrates to conduct Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed conjugated borylation followed by electrophilic intramolecular trapping that results into a pioneer transannular borylative ring closing reaction. The relative configuration of three adjacent stereocenters is controlled, giving access to a single diastereoisomer for a wide range of substrates tested. Moreover, when a chiral ligand is incorporated, the reaction provides enantioenriched polycyclic products with up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee.

      <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Copolymerization for a Homogenous Composite without an Interphase Boundary</title>
      <dc:description>
Organic and inorganic copolymerization by using acrylamide monomers and calcium phosphate oligomers as precursors results in an organic&#8211;inorganic composite without an interphase boundary. The material features significant mechanical enhancements that are due to the unique advantage of the homogenous composite structure.







Abstract
Ionic oligomers and their crosslinking implies a possibility to produce novel organic&#8211;inorganic composites by copolymerization. Using organic acrylamide monomers and inorganic calcium phosphate oligomers as precursors, uniformly structured polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;calcium phosphate copolymer is prepared by an organic&#8211;inorganic copolymerization. In contrast to the previous PAM&#8208;based composites by mixing inorganic components into polymers, the copolymerized material has no interphase boundary owing to the homogenous incorporation of the organic and inorganic units at molecular level, resulting in a complete and continuous hybrid network. The participation of the ionic binding effect in the crosslinking process can substantially improve the mechanical strength; the copolymer can reach a modulus and hardness of 35.14&#177;1.91&#8197;GPa and 1.34&#177;0.09&#8197;GPa, respectively, which are far superior to any other PAM&#8208;based composites.
