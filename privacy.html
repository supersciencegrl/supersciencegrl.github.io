					<h1>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h1>
					<p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed where the third parties involved in the processing are located.

If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Me with Personal Data, please contact Me. If I become aware that I have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, I will take steps to remove that information from the relevant third-party servers if possible.</p>
					<p>If I need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, I may require Your parent's consent before I collect and use that information.</p>

					<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
					<p>The Website contains links to other websites that are not operated by Me. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. I advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>
