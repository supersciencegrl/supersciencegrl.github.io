				<h6>SuperScienceGrl is 3 years old (tomorrow)! I can't honestly remember how it looked when it was launched.</h6>
				<p>But it's been fun, it taught me CSS and JavaScript right from the start, and since then I've started using Python to update some parts programmatically. 
					Looks like I'm still learning from it, as today I took some time to learn about Sass, and switch my CSS over to Sass to make it more readable and updatable.
				</p>
				<ul><li>I've pushed a homepage update. I was never quite sure what to do with the homepage, until now when I've tied it in more with the popular style of personal website at the moment. 
						I plan on adding more sections. I've not advertised it widely because it has my face on it. But there it is</li>
					<li>The online chemistry calendar is now over, having featured 1244 webinars, conferences, and training courses (Apr&ndash;Sep 2020). 
					It led out its full intended run up to Sep 2020, and its functionality and remaining content has now been ported over to 
					<a href="https://researchseminars.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://researchseminars.org/</a>, 
					which is a global, crowdsourced site, run by MIT academics</li>
					<li>As mentioned, I switched all my CSS over to .scss files with Sass. If I did it right, you won't see a change from this (apart from one very slight colour change to make things harmonious)</li>

					<ul><li>I'm currently updating the online calendar for chemistry events roughly daily - keep checking back for more events. This week is particularly packed!
						<br><a href="www.twitter.com/anywherechem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@AnywhereChem</a> on Twitter is doing a great job of aggregating these in social feed form.

						<li>I've added a Privacy Policy to the website footer, so you can see what I'm doing with your data. The main thing is that I'm using Google Analytics to keep track of anonymized data, to see how people interact with the website.

		<description><![CDATA[
					<p>My new <em>Chemistry World</em> article, is up, asking: "<a href="/pages/Who-is-a-scientist.html" target="_blank">who is a scientist, anyway?</a>"</p>
					<p>Whether in a lab, an office or on a stage, we are no strangers to wrestling with self-identity. Citizen scientists can build their confidence by engaging with real, scientific research, starting to feel that science is ‘for them’. However, this is still one of the factors that new researchers struggle with most. </p>]]>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I've been busy with starting my new job, so no update for a while means that this is a major one. I've been doing the following: </p>
					<ul><li>Updated the <a href="https://supersciencegrl.co.uk/about" target="_blank">About</a> page to reflect said <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/nessacarson/" target="_blank">new job</a></li>
					<li>Added a link to my new, interactive, highlightable <a href="https://supersciencegrl.co.uk/periodictable" target="_blank">periodic table</a>. I use it to keep a checklist of all the elements I've used during my time as a chemist, and now you can too! </li>
					<li>Added the ability to automatically search from the Google Chrome Omnibox using the Chemical Vendor Search tools to the <a href="https://supersciencegrl.co.uk/cvs" target="_blank">CVS</a> and <a href="https://supersciencegrl.co.uk/cvs-usa" target="_blank">CVS USA</a> pages</li>
					<li>Added &eta; and &kappa; to the <a href="https://supersciencegrl.co.uk/character-map" target="_blank">Character Map</a>, after I myself needed them for compound names this week and found them absent. Now it's more inclusive of inorganickers&hellip;</li>
					<li>Back end: updated the contact email encryption so it works better in 2019... sigh</li></ul>
					<p>Thanks for keeping up to date with my website. It's good fun and it keeps me learning. </p>]]>

					This is something I've been wanting to do for a while. Student and academic/postdoc options are now available on the <a href="https://supersciencegrl.co.uk/conferences" target="_blank">Conference Database</a>. 
					They're only visible on the desktop version, because the mobile version gets too crowded with the prices on there. Getting this update right took a while, but the hope is that academics that use it to fix their groups' conference schedules will be helped by this.
